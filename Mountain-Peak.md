**Nolok's Mountain Peak** is the final world in SuperTux. It houses Nolok's final fortress but the entrance door is locked and requiring
five keys spelling out Nolok's name. These keys can be found in each world prior in the hidden levels. Further development on this
world yet to be made. Though several ideas and concepts have been collected over time.

Once development on world 3 has reached a more final state world 4 will become the development teams next prioritised task.

Unlike previous worlds, world 4 will be rather small but much more difficult!

### Levels

There are no levels made for Nolok's Mountain Peak yet as active development on word 4 has yet to begin. It is planned to have 4 gameplay levels with a few cutscenes as well.

A small list of potential level ideas and themes:
- Industrial
- Bomb Factory
- Tower

Proposed names for the levels in Nolok's Mountain Peak:
- "Above the Clouds": Introductory cutscene where Tux must insert the keys.
- "Nolok's Bomb Factory": The industrial/bomb factory level.
- "Two Tiny Towers": The tower level.
- "I Spy With My Little Eye": The final platforming level, with a focus on the Ispy since it will be repurposed from a World 2 enemy to a World 4 one.
- "The Seated Throne": The final conflict with Nolok.
