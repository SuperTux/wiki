I think we should just stay with jam and diss SCons completely. Jam seems to do enough good. --[[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu]] 07:27, 7 Apr 2005 (BST)
: Yeah, that's most likely what's going to happen unless somebody volunteers to write a SCons script that suits our needs. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 17:32, 7 Apr 2005 (BST)

A "jam uninstall" target seems unnecessary to me. You can easily install in a separate prefix folder or use something like [[http://relink.sourceforge.net/ relink]].

'''''L:''' use the .hpp extension instead of .h to indicate the usage of c++''
:I don't really care for this idea, so I removed it from the TODO list for now. <tt>.h</tt> works just fine and anyone can easily see that the project is a C++ project with all the <tt>.cpp</tt> files. I don't really see any advantage to making this change, but I thought I should bring it here for discussion. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 22:03, 6 May 2005 (BST)
:I also have a pretty uninterested attitude towards this "issue". It's too much work changing a hell lot of files (CPP files, possibly Jamfiles, ...) just to show off C++ when we can already see it. (I remember the hell when I took the job of renaming "action()" to "update()"...) <nowiki>~~</nowiki>[[User:RavuAlHemio|Ravu]] 12:39, 9 May 2005 (BST)

-- Let me clarify this: We should rename the files anyway because writing this_file.* when it contains a ThisFile class is totally stupid. And when we're about to rename we should change .h to .hpp IMO. Some editors only display .h as C files.

: Then get a better editor :) I don't really have a problem with it but I don't (well, didn't) see any advantage to renaming to <tt>.h</tt>. If it's worth it for that reason, go ahead. I honestly don't see the problem with this_file.* containing the ThisFile class.. sure they are different, but they both follow conventions and are easy to figure out. If we do rename them (which I imagine we will :), I would personally prefer to keep everything lowercase so, for example, thisfile.* would contain the ThisFile class. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 01:28, 13 May 2005 (BST)
