=== Welcome to Antarctica ===

==== How do I get past the wall with the "run" sign next to it? ====

To jump high enough, Tux has to [[User Manual#Running (SuperTux 0.1)|run]] while jumping.

=== Arctic Ruins ===

==== Why can't I see any blocks to jump on? ====

There are a few cases where blocks you have to jump on are under water
and thus harder to see, maybe adjusting your screen's brightness/gamma
level will help.

=== Bonus Island ===

Icy Island's bonus level is reached through a teleporter.
Try going to the dead end near the bottom right corner and pressing enter.

=== Bouncy Coils ===

==== How do you use the second trampoline to jump past the cliff? ====

The trampoline is portable, so just pick it up and move it closer with the [[User Manual#Carrying Objects|action key]].

=== Under Construction (0.3.1) ===

==== How do you solve it? ====

Get the 3 keys hidden on forest island. The key levels have a key of some
color instead of a mushroom as their icon. Once you have those, you can go back to "Under Construction",
walk around, and something interesting will happen once you get to the tree stump.

=== Lights and Magic (0.3.0 Bonus Island) ===

==== Getting to it ====

There's a teleporter somewhere around "Three sheets to the wind,"
which you can activate by walking around and through it.
