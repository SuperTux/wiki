Note: General consensus was to avoid pipes in SuperTux. It's really a Mario thing and doesn't fit a penguin. Instead, different objects can be used to transfer Tux between [[sectors]], such as doors.

* Pipes that take Tux to sublevels
* Pipes that don't do anything (already in some levels.)
* Pipes Tux can walk thru, but you can't see him.
* Pipes that have water flowing thru them. These could have switches and take Tux different directions.
* Pipes that release water geysers or bubbles that take Tux to a different place.
