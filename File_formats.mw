This document serves the simple purpose of a reference for the files specific to SuperTux (levels, worldmaps, ...). Some of these files can be modified using an editor such as [flexlay.berlios.de/ Flexlay]. For the rest, you can use a plain text editor of your choice.

== Brackets, brackets, brackets (About the Language) ==
As you might have already noticed, the SuperTux definition files (just about for everything) are full of brackets ('(' and ')'). This might freak out a few BASIC or Python programmers who have pretty much developed a natural aversion against them.

"The Crazy File Format" used by SuperTux is [[S-expr]]. This syntax is mostly used by programming languages (such as Lisp or Scheme), but the devs simply thought why not to implement it as a data storage language. And so, the SuperTux data language was born.

=== Basic Syntax ===
So now you expect me to teach you S-expr. "You'd like that, wouldn't ya?" Okay, okay, let me teach you a bit.

Language syntax is (nearly) always best consumable when demonstrated on an example, like so:
<pre>(supertux-lisp-example
    ; This is a comment. It is initiated by a semi-colon. (Yes, you un-believer.)
    (some-integer 120)      ; Integer values are simple to input and to understand.
    (floaty-float 58.5)     ; Floating-point numbers should be self-explanatory too.
    (string-thong "omg")    ; Strings are simple and C-like.
    (intl-string (_ "wtf")) ; Internationalised strings are implemented not unlike in C with gettext.
    (boo-bool #t)           ; That's a "true"...
    (second-bool #f)        ; ... and that's a "false". (Well duh.)
    (integer-list 10 20 30) ; A list of integers, much like an array.
)  ; Don't forget the closing bracket!!!
</pre>

== Level Files ==
The level format is a bit complex, which is why [flexlay.berlios.de/ Flexlay] can prove itself very useful as an editor. If you are interested in how the levels look like or want to edit them manually (and find some of the parameters not self-explanatory enough), then you may read or skim through this section.

  (name (_ "Some demo level"))        ;; Name of the level. Call it a nice name. Note that this should be
                                      ;; internationalised (that's why the extra underscore and brackets).

=== Badguys ===
This section describes the various badguys and their parameters.

The next few sections describe the extra parameters for the other badguys.

==== Common parameters ====
<pre>(&lt;badguy-name&gt;
  (x 270)                 ;; The badguy's X coordinate.
  (y 126)                 ;; The badguy's Y coordinate. (Note that the origin is in the top-left corner!)
  (stay-on-platform #f)   ;; Optional. Should the badguy do its best not to fall from the platform it's on? (NYI)
)
</pre>

Bouncing Snowballs, Flying Snowballs, Jumpies, Mr Bombs, Mr Iceblocks, Mr Rockets, Mr Trees, World 1 Noloks, Poison Ivies, Snowballs, Spikies, Stalactites, Yeti Stalactites and Zeeklings only require this list of parameters. Simply substitute <tt><badguy-name></tt> with one of the following:

*<tt>bouncingsnowball</tt>
*<tt>flyingsnowball</tt>
*<tt>jumpy</tt>
*<tt>mrbomb</tt>
*<tt>mriceblock</tt>
*<tt>mrrocket</tt>
*<tt>mrtree</tt>
*<tt>nolok_01</tt>
*<tt>poisonivy</tt>
*<tt>snowball</tt>
*<tt>snowsnail</tt>
*<tt>spidermite</tt>
*<tt>spiky</tt>
*<tt>stalactite</tt>
*<tt>yeti_stalactite</tt>
*<tt>zeekling</tt>

==== Dispenser ====
<pre>(dispenser
  (cycle 3)               ;; How often should a badguy be dispensed?
  
  (badguy random)         ;; Valid values are "snowball", "bouncingsnowball", "mrbomb",
                          ;; "mriceblock", "mrrocket", "poisonivy", "snowsnail", or "random".
)</pre>

==== Flame ====
<pre>(flame
  (radius 3)              ;; How big should the radius of the circle be that the flame
                          ;; follows?
  
  (speed 10)              ;; How fast should the flame be?
)</pre>

==== Lightning orb ====
The lighting orb ("kugelblitz") ignores the <tt>y</tt> coordinate, spawning above the visible screen.

==== Spike ====
Don't mistake this badguy for Spiky! Spiky is the snowball-like creature with spikes, whilst a spike is an object serving the same purpose like the stalactite.

<pre>(spike
  (direction 2)           ;; 0: north, 1: south, 2: west, 3: east
)</pre>

==== Yeti ====
<pre>(yeti
  (dead-script "
// A squirrel script that is executed once the Yeti dies.
")
)</pre>

== Scrolling texts ==
Scrolling texts are used for the credits and were used for the intro and extro in Milestone 1. The format is simple:
<pre>(supertux-text
  (background "extro.jpg") ; Background image (see data/images/background)
  
  (speed 1.5)             ;; Default speed of text
  
  ;; Here we demonstrate the formatting characters
  (text (_ "

-This is a heading
<tab>This is a normal line.
 This is a line in a small font.
#This is a left-aligned line.
*This should be printed in a blue font.
!Filename of the picture to be embedded into the scrolling text (relative to scrolltext file path)

")
  )
)</pre>

== Worldmaps ==
Worldmaps are basically level files with a few nuances. To explain the syntax, let's just picture somebody with the idea to write a level set that takes place in London (represented by a lonely island):
<pre>(supertux-worldmap
  (properties                               ;; Global worldmap properties.
    (name (_ "London"))                     ;; Name of the worldmap
    (music "bigben.ogg")                    ;; Music to be played while on worldmap
  )
  (spawnpoint                               ;; At the moment, defining multiple spawnpoints on a worldmap is useless.
    (name "main")                           ;; Call your spawn point "main".
    (x 3)                                   ;; Note that the coordinates are, unlike in a level, bound to the tilemap.
    (y 3)
  )
  (tilemap
    (width 5)                               ;; Number of tiles in a row. Four is just for demonstrational purposes.
    (height 5)
    (layer "interactive")                   ;; This has to be "interactive".
    (solid #t)                              ;; This has to be true.
    (speed 1.000000)                        ;; This has to be 1.0.
    (tiles
      0  0  0  0  0                         ;; The tiles as defined in data/images/worldmap.strf.
      0  11 16 12 0
      0  15 60 17 0
      0  14 18 13 0
      0  0  0  0  0
    )
  )
  (level                                  ;; Add this block for each level. Continuing from a level tile is only possible when the level is completed.
    (x 3)                                 ;; Coordinates of the level entry point.
    (y 3)
    (name "heathrow.stl")                 ;; Filename of the level, relative to the location of the worldmap file.
    (extro-script "
// A Squirrel script to execute once this level is completed. Optional.
    ")
  )
  (special-tile                           ;; This is a sample message tile.
    (x 4)
    (y 3)
    (map-message (_ "Hello."))            ;; Display the following text when Tux steps on this tile.
    (passive-message #t)                  ;; Set to #f to draw a message sprite on the worldmap and to stop Tux when he steps on this tile.
    (apply-to-direction "north-west")     ;; The message is displayed only when Tux comes from one of the specified directions
                                          ;; (north, south, west, east, concatenate with a hyphen).
  )
  (special-tile                           ;; This is a sample portal tile.
    (x 2)
    (y 3)
    (map-message (_ "Warp to the Tower"))
    (teleport-to-x 1)                     ;; Worldmap coordinates to which Tux is teleported.
    (teleport-to-y 1)
  )
)</pre>

== Level subsets ==
Whilst creating a worldmap is optional, you'll need to write a level subset file to make your level package to appear in the contribs menu (or, ironically, inhibiting this behaviour). A file containing a level subset is called <tt>info</tt> and lies in <tt>data/levels/<subset_name>.</tt>
<pre>(supertux-level-subset
  (title (_ "Domain of the Hosek siblings"))                        ;; Give your levelset a nice name...
  (description (_ "Levels by Ondra and Klara, the Hosek siblings")) ;; ... and a short description.
  (hide-from-contribs #f)                                           ;; Set to true to hide the levelset from the "Contrib Levels" menu.
)</pre>
