'''Billboards''' are in-game explanations of game mechanics, such as the [[Fireflower]] or reset points.

== Extra Items ==

Egg needs a new graphic, Fireflower/Iceflower -> ?

== Crumbling Blocks ==

Change [[crumbling block]]s to be have like one of those:
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22RH2auraFs#t=3m40s Crumbling ground in Giana Sisters DS]
** Blocks crumble until they disappear. Then the player falls through.
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_SqtR3xFpM#t=1m20s Donut Blocks in Super Mario World]
** Blocks fall down without crumbling first. The player can still jump off of them.
Currently, they crumble and then fall down. Jumping off of them is not possible.

== Slope Tiles ==

== Reset Points ==

There shall be no reset points in the game, instead it should be made sure that levels are small enough to not require them. 

== No Lives ==

There will be no lives and no punishment for death aside from having to restart the level, due to the lack of reset points there simply is no need for lives.

== Collectibles ==

The game shall provide some form of special collectibles per level (5 special coins, 5 pieces of a crystal or stuff like that). How many of those collectibles are found is displayed in a prominent manner, not just part of the statistics. The Tux-doll (ex-1up) could be recycled for this purpose.
