**Bonus Island III** is the third of four Bonus Islands in SuperTux. This world is comprised of levels created by community members between 2010 and 2014.
This world was first released in *SuperTux 0.4.0*.

It is comprised of two major sections, an icy island and a forested island. Upon completion of the icy island, a warp will teleport the player to the forest island.

This worldmap was originally named **Mantis Valley** and featured a collection of levels uploaded by fans to the old bug tracker, however the world has since been expanded to include other add-on levels.
