Behavior: Rabbits bounce around hopping over small holes and barriers. They
::change direction for big barriers and fall into big holes (UNLESS stay on
::platform flag is on). They occasionally/often spawn new small bunnies who only
::jump over really small holes and barriers and eventually turn into big rabbits
::who spawn *more* little bunnies which turn into rabbits. Small bunnies can
::coexist with rabbits. Rabbits will duck to let other rabbits jump over them.
::Eventually however, the spawning stops when things get unreasonable.

Appearance: Bunnies are small forms of rabbits, the rest is undefined.

Hurt it: Bounce on it, spit, invincibility.

Hurt Tux: Other contact.
