**SuperTux Portable** aims to allow users to play SuperTux on embedded devices such as PDAs, the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or low-CPU PCs.

This page is meant to collect links to whatever ports are sitting around the internet. Note that the developers have nothing to do with these ports, so you're on your own when installing them or dealing with whatever problems they have.

Devices
-------

### iPhone

An iPhone port of the development version was being developed by a third party group, but has been put on hold due to GPL/App Store incompatibility: [1](http://lists.lethargik.org/pipermail/supertux-devel-lethargik.org/2010-March/002943.html) [2](http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/why-free-software-and-apples-iphone-dont-mix)

### Android

-   Port by pelya: [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lethargik.supertux2) [Web site](http://libsdl-android.sourceforge.net/) [GitHub](https://github.com/pelya/commandergenius/tree/sdl_android/project/jni/application/supertux)
    As of December 2014, this one uses a recent development snapshot (contrary to the Google Play screenshots) and receives updates from its developer. It is mostly playable, but with pitifully low framerates on some levels on a Nexus 5 and a 2013 LTE Nexus 7 both running the Carbon ROM.
