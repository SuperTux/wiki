__NOTOC__

== Summary ==
This module contains methods controlling the player. (No, SuperTux doesn't use mind control. Player refers to the type of the player object.)

== Instances ==
Due to SuperTux's single-player nature, there is only one instance of the <tt>Player</tt> object. You can access it via <tt>Tux</tt> from a script and <tt>sector.Tux</tt> from the console.

== Methods ==
{| class="objectlist"
! class="method"| add_bonus(string bonusname)
| Gives Tux the specified bonus. Replace <tt>bonusname</tt> with either of <tt>"grow"</tt>, <tt>"fireflower"</tt> or <tt>"iceflower"</tt>.
|-
! class="method" style="vertical-align: top"| add_coins(int number)
| Gives Tux <tt>number</tt> coins.<br />Tip: Tux has to pay 25 coins to be revived at the last firefly he visited. If he doesn't have enough coins, the player has to play the whole level again.
