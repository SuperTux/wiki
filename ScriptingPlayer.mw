__NOTOC__

== Summary ==
This module contains methods controlling the player. (No, SuperTux doesn't use mind control. Player refers to the type of the player object.)

== Instances ==
Due to SuperTux's single-player nature, there is only one instance of the <tt>Player</tt> object. You can access it via <tt>Tux</tt> from a script and <tt>sector.Tux</tt> from the console.
