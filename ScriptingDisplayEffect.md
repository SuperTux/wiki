Summary
-------

""DisplayEffect"" is an interface for toying with the display.

Instances
--------

SuperTux creates an instance named ""Effect"" when starting the scripting engine. Its usage is preferred â€“ creating another instance might have unexpected side effects and is strongly discouraged. (Use ""sector.Effect"" in the console.) 

Inheritance
--------

This class inherits functions and variables from the following base classes:
* [GameObject](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/ScriptingGameObject)


Methods
-------

Method | Explanation
-------|-------
`void fade_out(float time)` | Gradually fades out the screen to black for the next `time` seconds.
`void fade_in(float time)` | Gradually fades in the screen from black for the next `time` seconds.
`void set_black(bool black)` | Blackens or un-blackens the screen (depending on the value of `black`).
`bool is_black()` | Returns `true` if the screen has been blackened by `set_black`.
`void sixteen_to_nine(float time)` | Sets the display ratio to 16:9, effectively adding black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.
