= Release 0.3.0 (Tech Demo) =

This is the latest (but unstable) release of SuperTux, also known as "[[Milestone 1.9]]". The 0.3.0 release is meant as a tech-demo, to show of new features of the engine, new graphics and such, it is not meant to be fully playable or polished, for that reason it is recommend that distributions should not ship SuperTux 0.3.0, but instead the fully playable SuperTux 0.1.3 release. To download SuperTux 0.3.0, please find your system in the following table:
