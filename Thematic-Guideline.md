Something this game seems to be missing since most of its development time was a thematic guideline and a clarification
of such. This page is meant to fix some of those issues by laying down the main idea and concept for design and world/level
themes etc. for further development on the game's main story.

If you would like to contribute to help finishing the main game, we highly recommend reading through this document!

World Themes
------------

The game's world themes are chosen to be diverse in terms of overall appearance and climate and gameplay elements.
From the cold antarctic landscape to the lukewarm forests to the tropical beaches of a distant jungle, we want Tux's
journey to feature as much design variety as possible.

The first world, Icy Island, serves as the basic introduction into the games core mechanics. Rooted Forest, the game's
second world will introduce more complex and puzzle oriented elements. The third world, Tropical Paradise, is set to
lay a huge focus on Tux's swimming ability and take full advantage of it with more unique obstacles and challenges. The
fourth and final world, Nolok's Mountain Peak, will combine all elements of each world but in an even more challenging
way and with its own unique spin. It will also feature more mechanical elements, like a bomb factory or mechanical
badguys.

Worldmap Design
---------------

Similar to how a world's theme is chosen, each world is supposed to have its own unique worldmap design.

**Icy Island** is an antarctic island thus being designed to look like an island. **Rooted Forest**, unlike the game's
first world, is a not an island but part of a large landmass. In order to not have it be too big however, the game only
takes place on the southern part of the forest. Despite being island based again, **Tropical Paradise**'s uniqueness
comes from the fact that it is the only world that features multiple small isles rather than one big island.
**Nolok's Mountain Peak** compared to all other worlds is very small and takes place primarily inside a large fortress
located on a snowy mountain peak above the clouds.

Level Length
------------

Usually, levels in SuperTux are meant to be around 300 to 500 tiles in length. Around the middle a checkpoint must be
placed (preferably near harder section if possible). Levels that are more complex may be shorter to compensate the overall
playtime which is meant to be about 90 seconds per level.

An exception to this rule are either hidden bonus levels or levels that feature a theme only present in this one level
(e.g. The Crystal Mine). Those types of level are much longer featuring more complex puzzles, challenges etc. and take
much longer to beat. Additionally, more checkpoints must be placed! The total amount varies per level.

Boss Fights
-----------

The game is set to feature five boss enemies in total. Each boss has five lives in story mode and activates **Pinch Mode**
when on their last two lives. In Pinch Mode, bosses get new and more powerful attacks which are much harder to avoid.

All boss fights are meant to vary in how they are fought and how they behave.

- The **Yeti**, the boss of Icy Island, behaves like a more traditional, straightforward boss. He runs back and forth in a
  level and attacks upon reaching one side of the arena. Avoid his attacks and jump on his head. Simple.

- The fight against the **Ghost Tree**, the boss of Rooted Forest, will be more round based. Tux can only attack them during a
  certain attack whereas the Yeti can be attacked in between attack and even during his attacks (if skilled enough).

- The boss fight of Tropical Paradise against **Toucan** and **Master Totem** is unique in the way that Tux must fight two
  separate boss enemies at once (however they also separate from one another). Toucan attacks the player from high up while
  granting a chance for a counter attack every once and awhile. Master Totem, in the meantime, will attempt to hurt Tux with
  varying attacks. Its attacks are depended on their amount of lives!

- **Nolok** is the final boss of the game and is going to appear in Nolok's Mountain Peak. It is yet not confirmed how his boss
  fight is going to function. Either Nolok uses a combination of attacks based on past boss fights and his own unique attacks
  or Nolok only uses a unique moveset of his own.

Story Motives
-------------

Since this game is oriented primarily towards younger players, the story of the game is set to not be too deep and complex for a
simple platformer. Thus, we will not include heavy exploration of deep, emotional or dark themes!

The story is meant to be lighthearted first and foremost. For more insight on the game's current storyline, go
