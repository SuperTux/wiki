## Badguys of Icy Island

A badguy in SuperTux is a foe of Tux. They may not be "bad" in the way
that a hedgehog isn't really bad, but they can certainly hurt Tux.
Most of the badguys are creatures, like Snowballs with varying
characteristics, but some are more like objects (Stalactite for
example) or phenomena like Flame.

Tux will try to avoid approaching badguys if possible. If he runs into
one or one drops on his head, he is hurt. When hurt Tux will lose a
powerup or, if Tux has no powerups left, he will be killed.

Many of the badguys Tux can knock out by jumping on them and squishing
them. Others are only stunned by this for a short while or are
insusceptible to this and hurt Tux instead. As a rule of thumb,
badguys with a spiky head or helmet can usually not be jumped on. For
a list of badguys that can be squished take a look at the squishable
badguys category. Most badguys can be killed with the fire- or
iceflower power up.

This page shall describe all enemies, old and new, in as much detail
as possible. We also need to settle down on proper names for enemies,
since currently there is a lot of confusion. If you want see on real
names, click [here](real_badguys_names "wikilink").

Cannon (dispenser)
==================

![](images/Dispenser_rocket_launcher.png)

The cannon can be mounted on either static or rotatable pedestal. It
shoots angry looking snowballs. It is indestructible. [SVN](SVN
"wikilink") for non-captainsnowball/kamizazesnowball enemies

The version in SVN can in fact shoot [Snowshots](Snowshot "wikilink").
Can this sentence be removed or do you mean something else?

I didn't find any mention of [Captain Snowball](Captain_Snowball
"wikilink") in neither the Milestone 2 nor the Milestone 3 design
documents. What's the status on him? --[octo](User#octo "wikilink")

![Cannon](img/badguy/icons/Dispenser_rocket_launcher.png)

-   Image=Dispenser rocket launcher.png
-   Appearance=Differs, see below.
-   Behaviour=Spawns new badguys at fixed or random intervals.
-   Squish=yes
-   Buttjump=yes
-   Freeze=yes
-   Burnable=yes

A **Cannon** is a [game object](game_object "wikilink") that spawns new
[badguys](badguy "wikilink"). The interval in which badguys are spawned
is either fixed or random. A cannon can be shot with either the
[fireflower](fireflower "wikilink") (dies) or
[iceflower](iceflower "wikilink") (stops it emitting new badguys).
Whether or not the dispenser is squishable and butt-jumpable depends on
the appearance: The *trapdoor* and *rocket launcher* types are immune to
[Tux](Tux "wikilink") standing or jumping on them, the *cannon* type can
be broken this way.

It is also possible for the cannon to shoot inanimate, non-badguy
objects (even other cannons.)

### Appearance

There are three possible sprites for this object: Trapdoor, cannon and
(in lack of a better word) rocket launcher. Please note that despite the
name, *rocket launcher* is the preferred appearance, at least in [Icy
Island](Icy_Island "wikilink") ([Milestone 2](Milestone_2 "wikilink")).

### Design considerations

:   *This section is possibly outdated.*

### Mechanics

-   Spawns new Badguys
-   Interval: Fixed or random
-   Appearance: Trap door, cannon or invisible
-   Start direction of badguys: Fixed or random
-   Initial velocity of badguys: Fixed or random

### Uses

-   fires rockets
-   drops badguys from a (shootable) trap door
-   spawn badguys in tubes
-   launches molten rocks out of a lava lakes

### Comments

> [[Grumbel|User#grumbel]]: Overly complicated and configurable. It
> should focus on one thing and doing it well (i.e. shooting
> snowballs) instead of doing everything and than some. Might be best
> to discard the current `Dispenser` class and replace it with a Canon
> class.


Flame
=====

![Flame|right](images/Flame.png "fig:Flame|right") The flame rotates
around in a circle, hurting Tux when he gets too close. It is
indestructible. Do we want it to come in a line of fire?

![Flame](img/badguy/icons/Flame.png)


-   Appearance=A glowing sphere.
-   Behaviour=Follows a circular path around a certain point.
-   Squish=no
-   Buttjump=no
-   Freeze=yes
-   Burnable=no

**Flames** are [badguys](badguys "wikilink") found in both
[worlds](worlds "wikilink") in *SuperTux*. They move in fixed circles,
hurting [Tux](Tux "wikilink") and other badguys on contact (unless, of
course, Tux is in invincibility mode.) Flames are immune to fire.
However, ice balls can kill them permanently as of version 0.3.4.


Haywire
=======

![](img/badguy/icons/MrBombCrazy.png)

A purple walking bomb.

When the fuse isn't burning Haywire looks similar to a normal Bomb
except color and face. When the fuse of Haywire gets activated he
starts to run around, maybe chasing Tux. He can't be carried around.
Jumping on him when the fuse is burning will cause Tux to bounce and
Haywire to be stunned for a short moment (fraction of a second).

**Haywire** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") from the [Milestone 2
Design Document](Milestone_2_Design_Document "wikilink"). It is very
similar to [Mr. Bomb](Mr._Bomb "wikilink"): When jumped upon, the
explosion sequence is triggered. In contrast to *Mr. Bomb*, *Haywire*
will not lie still but ran around madly. [Tux](Tux "wikilink") can stun
*Haywire* for a short while by jumping on it again, but should try to
get out of its reach. When it explodes, hurts [Tux](Tux "wikilink") and
other badguys nearby.


Behaviour=Walks around. When jumped on, it's stunned for a little
while and its explosion sequence is triggered.

When shot with a [Fireflower](Fireflower "wikilink"), explodes
immediately.

### Comments

> [[Grumbel|User#grumbel]]: Visually not distinct enough. Sound
> effects terrible. Behaviour change when jumped uppon not dangerous
> enough. See [Concept Art](images/Milestone2-sprites.png).


Mr. Bomb
========

![Mr. Bomb](img/badguy/icons/Mrbomb.png)

The base behavior of Mr. Bomb is similar to the normal Snowball,
except that when hit he doesn't get squished, but knocked out and his
fuse starts burning.

After ~5 seconds he then explodes. While the fuse is burning he
doesn't move, but instead can be carried around like an iceblock.
Throwing MrBombs is more like a normal throw, not like MrIceblock
getting kicked.

Walks around. When jumped on once, it is activated and explodes after
a short time, killing nearby badguys.

When Tux or another badguy hits him, he stops and begins ticking.
After a few seconds, he explodes, hurting all creatures within range.
The presence of other Mr. Bombs during explosion may cause a chain
reaction of explosions. He also explodes if he is hit by one of Tux's
fireballs, but if hit by an iceball, he freezes without exploding.

### Comments

> [[Grumbel|User#grumbel]]: Time to explosion is too short, blinking
> doesn't signal time to explosion well enough, making it almost
> impossible to carry it around to do anything. Fuse doesn't actually
> burn when activated.


Short Fuse
==========

![](images/Short-Fuse.png "fig:Short_Fuse.png")
![Mini-Bomb](images/Minibomb.png "fig:Mini-Bomb") The Mini-Bomb is an
small version of the normal bomb, it approaches in groups most of the
time and is aggressive, it however is non-lethal to Tux and only works
to either distract him and throw him back.

A first version of this badguy has been added to [SVN](SVN "wikilink") in [6511](Template:Revision "wikilink").

Should “pop” like it was filled with air pressure air, not explode in fire, to make it clear that its not deadly.

![Short Fuse](img/badguy/icons/Short_Fuse.png)

- Behaviour=Walks around excitedly. Falls off platforms.
- Squish=yes
- Buttjump=yes
- Freeze=no
- Burnable=yes

His behavior is intended to be similar to that of [Mr. Bomb](#mr-bomb),
but the explosions do not harm Tux -- they only throw him back.
