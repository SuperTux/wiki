These guidelines should be kept for any level that appears in the main
SuperTux [Story Mode](Story-Mode"wikilink"). Any deviation should be rare and with great
consideration (for example for a secret area). Designers making custom
levels intended for an [Add-on](Add-on "wikilink") or Bonus Island are
free of regulations - that's what those sections are for. However,
keep in mind that if your levels violate too many of these guidelines
people will likely find them not very fun, so it's recommended to follow these
guidelines for those levels, too. 

Setting
-------

[Milestone 2](Milestone_2 "wikilink"), will have [Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink") as game discovering area, the island
already present in [Milestone 1](Milestone_1 "wikilink"). It has a
snow and ice setting, so please use the appropriate [tiles](tile
"wikilink") only. Most of them are in the “Snow” and “Blocks” groups
in the level editor. There are numerous other tiles currently
available in the editor, but they are either either not finalized
(e.g. ice mountain) or not appropriate for *Icy Island*. Then, the story will present a revised
[Forest](Forest "wikilink"), where more elaborate elements may be
found. Both Icy and Forest Bosses are somewhat unstable, so they will change in the future. 

Difficulty
----------

The goal of *SuperTux* is to be fun, not to be hard. So the goal is to
make *fun* levels, not to make them *challenging*. Remember that a
player will get frustrated and annoyed if he dies more than small
number of times in a level and also keep in mind that a player will
see the level for the first time when he plays it.

**Tip:** If you are in doubt if a level is getting too hard, change
the style of play to something that is unfamiliar to you, invert
left/right controls, play with the left hand, play only as small Tux
or anything like that. If you can still beat the level without
problems and without dying, it likely is easy enough. If not, then it
is likely too hard.

Do's and Don'ts
---------------

| Don't: | Do: |
| ------ | --- |
| Place random enemies of all kinds. | Choose between 5-10 similarly themed enemies that fit in your level. |
| Place enemies where they will die before Tux sees them. | Make sure they can't die before Tux sees them, so they can challenge Tux. |
| Place enemies where they will have unpredictable behaviour. (Near a spawn point, near a reset point, on a slope, or near a door)| Make sure that Tux has time to know where they will go before he interacts with them. |
| Place Flying Snowballs where Tux has to jump on them to pass. | Use an enemy with a more predictable path, or make sure Tux can pass without having to bounce off enemies. |
| Make Icecrushers get stuck while trying to reach their original position. | Make sure their hitboxes line up so they don't get stuck while returning to their original positions. |
| Use slopes with sudden jumps in inclination. | Make sure the slopes are smooth in transitioning from flat land to sloped land. |
| Use tiles that are made for solid land in the background or foreground. |  Use the tiles that were made for the background or foreground and use different tiles for the solid layer. Make sure the player can distinguish between the background and solid layers. |
| Mix tilesets, like forest tiles and snow tiles. | Use tiles that fit the level's theme. |
| Make sectors less than 25 tiles high or 40 wide. | Make sure that they are at least 25 tiles high and 40 wide, so they look good in every resolution currently supported by the game. |

What to Avoid
-------------

1. Paths with a spike on the floor and one on the roof.
2. Creating paths less than 4 tiles high and having untouchables (spikys, spikes) Tux has to jump over.
3. Jumps which require pixel perfect precision to complete.
4. Invisible tiles in normal gameplay.
5. Large monotonous areas which don't provide much gameplay.
6. Dead ends or impossible levels. The player should not only be able to finish the level, but fill out all the stats.
7. Levels that are too hard or too easy, or levels without varying difficulty.
