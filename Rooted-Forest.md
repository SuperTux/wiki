**Rooted Forest** is the second world in SuperTux. It is generally a lively place with many creatures roaming about.
Parts of the forest however, are corrupted. This world is currently still under development but can already be accessed
in story mode, and has been in the game for a while now. This world was included in the unstable *SuperTux 0.3*.

Its subworld is the **Corrupted Forest**. A larger section of the forest overtaken by an eerie disease.

### Levels

Rooted Forest is still under development and therefore it is not reasonable to state which levels exist.
Many will be removed or changed.
