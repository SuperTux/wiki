A badguy in SuperTux is a foe of Tux. They may not be "bad" in the way
that a hedgehog isn't really bad, but they can certainly hurt Tux.
Most of the badguys are creatures, like Snowballs with varying
characteristics, but some are more like objects (Stalactite for
example) or phenomena like Flame.

Tux will try to avoid approaching badguys if possible. If he runs into
one or one drops on his head, he is hurt. When hurt Tux will lose a
powerup or, if Tux has no powerups left, he will be killed.

Many of the badguys Tux can knock out by jumping on them and squishing
them. Others are only stunned by this for a short while or are
insusceptible to this and hurt Tux instead. As a rule of thumb,
badguys with a spiky head or helmet can usually not be jumped on. For
a list of badguys that can be squished take a look at the squishable
badguys category. Most badguys can be killed with the fire- or
iceflower power up.

Bouncing\_Snowball
===================

-   Name=Bouncing Snowball
-   Image=Bouncingsnowball.png
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink")
-   Appearance=A [Snowball](Snowball "wikilink") with eyes but without
    feet.
-   Behaviour=Jumps around. Jumping is affected by walls and other
    badguys.
-   Squish=yes
-   Buttjump=yes
-   Freeze=no
-   Burnable=yes
-   FirstVersion=0.1

**Bouncing Snowball** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") in [Icy
Island](Icy_Island "wikilink"). He bounces around, occasionally hitting
Tux or even other badguys. In version 0.1.3, he always bounces in the
same direction, regardless of the angle of the surface that he hits. The
bouncing action in 0.3 and above is more realistic.

Cannon
===================

-   Name=Cannon (dispenser)
-   Image=Dispenser rocket launcher.png
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink"),
    [Forest](Forest "wikilink")
-   Appearance=Differs, see below.
-   Behaviour=Spawns new badguys at fixed or random intervals.
-   Squish=yes
-   Buttjump=yes
-   Freeze=yes
-   Burnable=yes
-   FirstVersion=Milestone 2

A **Cannon** is a [game object](game_object "wikilink") that spawns new
[badguys](badguy "wikilink"). The interval in which badguys are spawned
is either fixed or random. A cannon can be shot with either the
[fireflower](fireflower "wikilink") (dies) or
[iceflower](iceflower "wikilink") (stops it emitting new badguys).
Whether or not the dispenser is squishable and butt-jumpable depends on
the appearance: The *trapdoor* and *rocket launcher* types are immune to
[Tux](Tux "wikilink") standing or jumping on them, the *cannon* type can
be broken this way.

It is also possible for the cannon to shoot inanimate, non-badguy
objects (even other cannons.)

### Appearance

There are three possible sprites for this object: Trapdoor, cannon and
(in lack of a better word) rocket launcher. Please note that despite the
name, *rocket launcher* is the preferred appearance, at least in [Icy
Island](Icy_Island "wikilink") ([Milestone 2](Milestone_2 "wikilink")).

Image:Dropper.png Image:Working.png Image:Dispenser rocket launcher.png

### Design considerations

:   *This section is possibly outdated.*

### Mechanics

-   Spawns new Badguys
-   Interval: Fixed or random
-   Appearance: Trap door, cannon or invisible
-   Start direction of badguys: Fixed or random
-   Initial velocity of badguys: Fixed or random

### Uses

-   fires rockets
-   drops badguys from a (shootable) trap door
-   spawn badguys in tubes
-   launches molten rocks out of a lava lakes



Captain\_Snowball
===================

-   Name=Captain Snowball
-   Image=
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink")
-   Appearance=A walking pirate snowball with eyes and boots on.
-   Behaviour=Walks slower then the average snowball. Falls down from
    all cliffs.
-   Squish=yes
-   Buttjump=yes
-   Freeze=no
-   Burnable=yes
-   FirstVersion=

**Captain Snowball** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") planned to debut
in version 0.4. There are not yet many levels which feature *Captain
Snowball*, but he will most likely appear in [Icy
Island](Icy_Island "wikilink") levels or other snow-themed levels.

Planned for 0.4. In [SVN](SVN "wikilink") since
[5323](Template:Revision "wikilink").

![](Boarding-nq8.png "Boarding-nq8.png")



Crystallo
===================

-   Name=Crystallo
-   Image=
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink")
-   Appearance=An ice crystal.
-   Behaviour=Moves around but doesn't leave a certain point.
-   Squish=yes
-   Buttjump=yes
-   Freeze=no
-   Burnable=yes
-   FirstVersion=Milestone 2

**Crystallo** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") in [Icy
Island](Icy_Island "wikilink"). He moves back and forth in a fixed
range. He is not yet widely used, but he has been implemented in some
test levels and some user-submitted levels.



Dart\_Trap
===================

<Template:NeedSound>

-   Name=Dart Trap
-   Image=
-   FoundIn=[Forest](Forest "wikilink")
-   Appearance=A skull mounted to the wall.
-   Behaviour=Static. Shoots darts at regular intervals.
-   Squish=no
-   Buttjump=no
-   Freeze=no
-   Burnable=no
-   FirstVersion=0.3

The **Dart trap** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") in form of a skull.
In regular intervals it shoots darts out of its mouth. The darts fly in
a straight line, hurt [Tux](Tux "wikilink") and cannot be destroyed but
must be avoided. The *Dart trap* is mostly found in castles in the
[Forest](Forest "wikilink") world.

### To be done

<Template:outdated>

-   mechanical sound when dart is loaded
-   hissing sound when dart is fired
-   clicking sound when dart hits the wall

:   i belive this is already implemented in milestone 1.5 & subversion

Fish
===================

-   Name=Fish
-   Image=FishBlue.png
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink"),
    [Forest](Forest "wikilink")
-   Appearance=A fish jumping out of water.
-   Behaviour=Jumps up out of water regularly.
-   Squish=no
-   Buttjump=no
-   Freeze=yes
-   Burnable=yes
-   FirstVersion=Milestone 2

**Fish** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") that jumps out of water. When
[Tux](Tux "wikilink") has to cross the water he has to pay attention to
the fish so he doesn't get caught.

### Proposed changes

<Template:Proposed>

Maybe a different color can be used in the forest world than in the
[Icyisland](Icyisland "wikilink").

Also, possibly there should be a few different types of fish:

1.  Standard up-and-down movement
2.  Curving Jump landing in a different place, going back and forth
3.  Archer Fish
    -   Stays below the surface of the water, but follows tux when he is
        on platforms above
    -   Shoots high pressure water which can break blocks and knock Tux
        into water where the archer fish can get him
4.  Swordfish
    -   Curving Jump following Tux and jumping higher when there is a
        chance to get Tux



Flame
===================

-   Name=Flame
-   Image=
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink"),
    [Forest](Forest "wikilink")
-   Appearance=A glowing sphere.
-   Behaviour=Follows a circular path around a certain point.
-   Squish=no
-   Buttjump=no
-   Freeze=yes
-   Burnable=no
-   FirstVersion=0.1

**Flames** are [badguys](badguys "wikilink") found in both
[worlds](worlds "wikilink") in *SuperTux*. They move in fixed circles,
hurting [Tux](Tux "wikilink") and other badguys on contact (unless, of
course, Tux is in invincibility mode.) Flames are immune to fire.
However, ice balls can kill them permanently as of version 0.3.4.



Flying\_Snowball
===================

-   Name=Flying Snowball
-   Image=Flyingsnowball.png
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink")
-   Appearance=A [Snowball](Snowball "wikilink") with a propeller
    underneath and a pilot hat and goggles.
-   Behaviour=Flies up and down constantly.
-   Squish=yes
-   Buttjump=yes
-   Freeze=no
-   Burnable=yes
-   FirstVersion=0.1

**Flying Snowball** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") often found in [Icy
Island](Icy_Island "wikilink"). It is a flying version of
[Snowball](Snowball "wikilink") which doesn't walk around but moves up
and down at random intervals and speeds.



Haywire
===================

-   Name=Haywire
-   Image=MrBombCrazy.png
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink")
-   Appearance=A purple walking bomb.
-   Behaviour=Walks around. When jumped on, it's stunned for a little
    while and its explosion sequence is triggered.
-   Squish=yes
-   Buttjump=yes
-   Freeze=yes
-   Burnable=yes
-   FirstVersion=Milestone 2

**Haywire** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") from the [Milestone 2
Design Document](Milestone_2_Design_Document "wikilink"). It is very
similar to [Mr. Bomb](Mr._Bomb "wikilink"): When jumped upon, the
explosion sequence is triggered. In contrast to *Mr. Bomb*, *Haywire*
will not lie still but ran around madly. [Tux](Tux "wikilink") can stun
*Haywire* for a short while by jumping on it again, but should try to
get out of its reach. When it explodes, hurts [Tux](Tux "wikilink") and
other badguys nearby.

When shot with a [Fireflower](Fireflower "wikilink"), explodes
immediately.

Ispy
===================

-   Name=Ispy
-   Image=
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink"),
    [Forest](Forest "wikilink")
-   Appearance=A spying eye.
-   Behaviour=Static, looking towards the nearest player.
-   Squish=no
-   Buttjump=no
-   Freeze=yes
-   Burnable=no
-   FirstVersion=

**Ispy** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") that can be found in all
[worlds](worlds "wikilink") of *SuperTux*. It is a spying eye looking
for the player. When the player can be seen by the eye, i.e. no other
badguys or walls are in the way, an action is triggered, for example
doors close or bridges are removed.

![](ChristophEstart.png "ChristophEstart.png")

Jumpy
===================

-   Name=Jumpy
-   Image=Left-up.png
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink"),
    [Forest](Forest "wikilink")
-   Appearance=A spiky grey ball with a spring underneath.
-   Behaviour=Jumps up and down.
-   Squish=no
-   Buttjump=no
-   Freeze=yes
-   Burnable=yes
-   FirstVersion=0.1

**Jumpy** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") found in many levels. He is
stationary, bouncing up and down on the spot. Unless
[Tux](Tux "wikilink") has a [fireflower](fireflower "wikilink") or an
[iceflower](iceflower "wikilink"), the only way to get past *Jumpy* is
to run below him or jump over him at the right time.



Krush\_and\_Krosh
===================

-   Name=Krush and Krosh (icecrusher)
-   Image=Iceblock.png
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink")
-   Appearance=An ice block (two by two for Krush, four by four for
    Krosh) making an angry face.
-   Behaviour=Clings to the ceiling until [Tux](Tux "wikilink") is
    underneath. Then drops with unstoppable force.
-   Squish=no
-   Buttjump=no
-   Freeze=no
-   Burnable=no
-   FirstVersion=Milestone 2

**Krush** and **Krosh** are [badguys](badguy "wikilink") found in [Icy
Island](Icy_Island "wikilink"). They are usually found on ceilings. If
Tux comes underneath one, it suddenly drops without warning. If Tux does
not get out of the way fast, he is hurt. After they hit the ground, they
slowly drift back up. On this “return trip,” Tux may safely climb on top
of them and hitch a ride.

Both “icecrushers” are available in [SVN](SVN "wikilink"), but only
Krush is implemented in levels.

Kugelblitz
===================

-   Name=Kugelblitz
-   Image=Flying-0.png
-   FoundIn=*n/a*
-   Appearance=A *ball lightning* with sparks.
-   Behaviour=Moves to the ground, then randomly to the left and right
    within a limited range.
-   Squish=no
-   Buttjump=no
-   Freeze=no
-   Burnable=no

:   *This [badguy](badguy "wikilink") has been removed from the
    [Milestone 2](Milestone_2 "wikilink") branch in
    [6282](Template:Revision "wikilink").*

**Kugelblitz** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") not widely used in
*SuperTux* yet. The *Kugelblitz* moves down to the ground and then
randomly left and right within a limited range. After a couple of
seconds it vanishes. Like the [Flame](Flame "wikilink") it cannot be
hurt but [Tux](Tux "wikilink") has to avoid it if possible. “Kugelblitz”
is German for “ball lightning”.

### Design considerations

The *Kugelblitz* (German for [“ball
lightning”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_lightning)) falls from the
sky without warning; as soon as it hits the ground, it starts moving
back and forth randomly for about two or three seconds in a fixed range,
then vanishes with a pop in a cloud of smoke. Explodes on contact which
hurts Tux. Alternatively, instead of moving at a random pattern, it
could also move between coins or badguys.

The Kugelblitz cannot be hurt, the player has to avoid its radius until
it's gone. With the alternative version, Tux can collect all
coins/destroy all badguys before the Kugelblitz lands to make it
disappear at once. It looks like a yellowish glowing wheel with
animations for falling (with glowing trail), rolling, exploding and
vanishing in smoke. It can be used in Ghost Forest and Forest Castle
settings.

If the Kugelblitz hits water it vanishes and all water tiles get
electrified for a short period of time. During that time, contact with
water causes Tux and badguys to get hurt.

(I chose the German name because it's one of the few words that actually
sound cooler in German than in English, IMHO.)

Variation1
==========

The path of the kugelblitz could be led by looking at surrounding
things. For example the kugelblitz could always go the nearest coin or
enemy in a range of 3 tiles give that it would not need to change it's
direction more than 45 degree or so. This would allow the following 2
situations:

![](Kugelblitz2.jpg "Kugelblitz2.jpg")

The kugelblitz would go down and then go upwards along the 2 coins and
finally killing the 2 spikies and disappearing as there is no object
anymore it could move to.

![](Kugelblitz1.jpg "Kugelblitz1.jpg")

The kugelblitz would come down and start moving in circles from coin to
coin. You could stop this behaviour by collecting 1 of the coins at the
right time.

More Ideas
==========

-   The kugelblitz could be attracted to spikes and if it hits them
    disappear. Like a lightning arrester.

Mr. Bomb
===================

-   Name=Mr. Bomb
-   Image=Mrbomb.png
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink"),
    [Forest](Forest "wikilink")
-   Appearance=A blue walking bomb.
-   Behaviour=Walks around. When jumped on once, it is activated and
    explodes after a short time, killing nearby badguys.
-   Squish=yes
-   Buttjump=yes
-   Freeze=yes
-   Burnable=yes
-   FirstVersion=0.1

**Mr. Bomb** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") that can be found in all
[worlds](worlds "wikilink") of *SuperTux*. When Tux or another badguy
hits him, he stops and begins ticking. After a few seconds, he explodes,
hurting all creatures within range. The presence of other Mr. Bombs
during explosion may cause a chain reaction of explosions. He also
explodes if he is hit by one of Tux's fireballs, but if hit by an
[iceball](Iceflower "wikilink"), he freezes without exploding.

<div style="clear: both;">
</div>
![Old image of Mr. Bomb](Mrbomb-left-0.png "fig:Old image of Mr. Bomb")
Due to Grumbel's complaint that “Mr. Bomb is the ugliest badguy ever
created”, user [Poison Ivy](User:Poison_Ivy "wikilink") created a
concept image for a new look by combining features of
[Snowball](Snowball "wikilink") and the old Mr. Bomb in Gimp. This
approach was not accepted either.



Mr.\_IceBlock
===================

-   Name=Mr. IceBlock
-   Image=Mr iceblock.gif
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink")
-   Appearance=A cube of ice with eyes and legs.
-   Behaviour=Walks around. When jumped on once, it becomes a kickable
    and portable block of ice.
-   Squish=yes
-   Buttjump=yes
-   Freeze=no
-   Burnable=yes
-   FirstVersion=0.1

**Mr. IceBlock** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") in [Icy
Island](Icy_Island "wikilink") with moderately complex behavior. In his
ordinary form, he works like an ordinary walking badguy, turning around
upon reaching walls and falling off cliffs. In version 0.3 and above, he
only walks off a cliff if there is something safe on which he can land.

When stomped on for the first time, Mr. IceBlock suddenly stops short.
If he is not stomped again for the next few seconds, he returns back to
normal. However, if he is stomped once more while squished, he suddenly
skids rapidly in one direction, hurting all creatures that he hits. When
skidding, he bounces off walls and falls off cliffs. If another creature
(including Tux) can stomp on him while he is skidding, he stops short
once more (and if he is stomped again, he begins skidding again, and so
on.)

While squished, Mr. IceBlock can also be “kicked,” if Tux runs up right
against him, and “carried” with the Action button. If Tux carries him
and lets go of Mr. IceBlock, he suddenly begins skidding in the
direction Tux is facing.

Continually squishing Mr. IceBlock will eventually kill him.

<div style="clear: both;">
</div>
### Behavior in [Milestone 1](Milestone_1 "wikilink")

![Old image of Mr.
IceBlock](Mriceblock-left-2.png "fig:Old image of Mr. IceBlock") If Mr.
IceBlock is eliminated, Tux is awarded 100 points. If destroyed via
repeated squishes, Tux can get up to 550 points.

When carrying Mr. IceBlock, Tux is granted a “get out of jail free”
card: if he hits another, non-invincible badguy, both Mr. IceBlock and
the other badguy are killed, leaving Tux unharmed. A minor glitch
occurs: Mr. IceBlock is scored as 0 points.

Mrs. IceBlock
=============

* Name=Mrs. IceBlock
* Image=Mrs iceblock.gif
* FoundIn=[[Icy Island]]
* Appearance=A pink cube of ice with eyes and legs.
* Behaviour=Walks around. When jumped on once, it becomes a kickable and portable block of ice.
* Squish=yes
* Buttjump=yes
* Freeze=no
* Burnable=yes
* FirstVersion=3.4

'''Mrs. IceBlock''' is a [[badguy]] in [[Icy Island]] with moderately complex behavior. In his ordinary form, he works like an ordinary walking badguy, turning around upon reaching walls or cliffs. 

When stomped on for the first time, Mrs. IceBlock suddenly stops short. If he is not stomped again for the next few seconds, he returns back to normal. However, if he is stomped once more while squished, he suddenly skids rapidly in one direction, hurting all creatures that he hits. When skidding, he bounces off walls and falls off cliffs. If another creature (including Tux) can stomp on him while he is skidding, he stops short once more (and if he is stomped again, he begins skidding again, and so on.)

While squished, Mrs. IceBlock can also be "kicked," if Tux runs up right against him, and "carried" with the Action button. If Tux carries him and lets go of Mr. IceBlock, he suddenly begins skidding in the direction Tux is facing. 

Continually squishing Mrs. IceBlock will eventually kill him.

Mrs.\_Snowball
===================

-   Name=Mrs. Snowball (smartball)
-   Image=
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink")
-   Appearance=A walking snowball with eyes and boots on.
-   Behaviour=Walks around. Stays on platforms.
-   Squish=yes
-   Buttjump=yes
-   Freeze=no
-   Burnable=yes
-   FirstVersion=Milestone 2

**Mrs. Snowball** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") found in [Icy
Island](Icy_Island "wikilink"). In contrast to
(Mr.) [Snowball](Snowball "wikilink") she will stay on platforms rather
than falling down. [Tux](Tux "wikilink") can easily handle these
“badgals” by jumping on them, squishing them in the process.

This badguy is planned for [Milestone 2](Milestone_2 "wikilink"). It is
in SVN since [5321](Template:Revision "wikilink").



Owl
===================

<Template:NeedGraphics>

-   Name=Owl
-   Image=
-   FoundIn=[Icy Island](Icy_Island "wikilink")
-   Appearance=A blue owl carrying objects around.
-   Behaviour=Flies left and right. Turns around when it hits a wall.
-   Squish=yes
-   Buttjump=yes
-   Freeze=no
-   Burnable=yes
-   FirstVersion=Milestone 2

The **Owl** is a [badguy](badguy "wikilink") from the [Milestone 2
Design Document](Milestone_2_Design_Document "wikilink"). It flies high
up in the air and carries badguys around. When Tux is below it, it will
drop whatever it is carrying.

This badguy is in the [SVN](SVN "wikilink") repository since
[6558](Template:Revision "wikilink"). The graphics for this badguy still
need to be improved. The graphics currently in SVN are colorized
versions of the concept graphics, basically.

Yeti
====

![](Yeti2.png "Yeti2.png")

The **Yeti** is the boss for [Icyisland](Icyisland "wikilink")

Inspiration
-----------

As the first world is an Icyisland, a yeti as boss would match the thematics perfectly.

Here are some random links to get inspired for Yetis:

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti>
-   <http://www.state2.de/images/Yeti-neu.jpg>
-   <http://www.hollywoodjesus.com/movie/monster_inc/20.jpg>

### Concept art

Image:Yetiboss.jpg Image:Yeti2.jpg Image:Yeti\_concept.png Image:Yeti\_scan\_roughs.png Image:Yeti concept throw.png

Behaviour
---------

The Yeti stands on the hill on the right or left and does 1 of the following things

-   throwing snowballs at tux
-   shouting angrily and jumping up and down. This would have the effect that 2 or 3 of the stalactites on the top of the screen start shaking and fall down.
-   he jumps off the hill and runs towards the other side of the screen. This would be the moment where tux is able to hurt him by jumping on him.

Finish
------

After 3-5 hits the yeti should give up and the screen fade away. Maybe in a short sequence the Yeti could show tux a slide down his hill with a ramp at the end that would bring tux to the next world (animated in the worldmap screen).


BadGuys
=======
![Flying Snowball](Flyingsnowball.png "fig:Flying Snowball") ![Mr. Bomb](Mrbomb.png "fig:Mr. Bomb") A **badguy** in *SuperTux* is a foe of [Tux](Tux "wikilink"). They may not be “bad” in the way that a hedgehog isn't really bad, but they can certainly hurt Tux. Most of the badguys are creatures, like [Snowballs](Snowball "wikilink") with varying characteristics, but some are more like objects ([Stalactite](Stalactite "wikilink") for example) or phenomena like [Flame](Flame "wikilink").

Tux will try to avoid approaching badguys if possible. If he runs into one or one drops on his head, he is hurt. When hurt Tux will lose a [powerup](powerup "wikilink") or, if Tux has no powerups left, will be pushed off the screen.

Many of the badguys Tux can knock out by jumping on them and squishing them. Others are only stunned by this for a short while or are insusceptible to this and hurt Tux instead. As a rule of thumb, badguys with a spiky head or helmet can usually not be jumped on. For a list of badguys that can be squished take a look at the [squishable badguys category](:Category:Squishable_badguys "wikilink").
