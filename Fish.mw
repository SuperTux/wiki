Maybe a different color can be used in the forest world than in the [[Icyisland]].

Also, possibly there should be a few different types of fish:

# Standard up-and-down movement
# Curving Jump landing in a different place, going back and forth
# Archer Fish
#* Stays below the surface of the water, but follows tux when he is on platforms above
#* Shoots high pressure water which can break blocks and knock Tux into water where the archer fish can get him
# Swordfish
#* Curving Jump following Tux and jumping higher when there is a chance to get Tux
