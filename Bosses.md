The **Yeti** is the boss enemy that awaits Tux after the castle of [Icy Island](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Icy-Island),
in the level *No More Mr Ice Guy*.
He is a massive, fuzzy creature preying on Tux in the cold. He may not be the brightest
but proves to be quite a threat when enraged.

#### Attacks
The Yeti will attack the player in two different ways. First, he will rush towards the player,
going from one side to the other. This maneuver is then followed by him stomping three times which
attacks Tux indirectly by making icicles fall down.

### Ghost Tree

*(Note: The Ghost Tree is a work in progress. Although it is unfinished some incomplete graphics can be found in the game.)*

The Ghost Tree, a large errie, purple tree with deep, dark holes as eyes, is the end boss of
[Rooted Forest](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Rooted-Forest).
The ghost tree awaits Tux in the second castle. Planted by Nolok,
the Ghost Tree began spreading a horrible disease through out the forest through its roots.

#### Attacks
The Ghost Tree primarily will attack the player from below with its roots, bursting out of the
ground. These can be anticipated by the cracks appearing on the ground. Its other attacks are
depended on which *Ghost Orb* they absorbed prior.


## Planned Bosses

### Toucan

The large and emposing **Toucan**, accompanied by his **Master Totems**, rules over the tropical temples and
is the end boss of [Tropical Paradise](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Tropical-Paradise).

### Nolok

See [Nolok](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Characters#Nolok) for details.

## Mini Bosses

It is yet still unclear if mini bosses are going to be a thing in the actual game. Since entities such as **Shadow Tux** are confirmed to be added
(though not classified as a mini boss at the moment) a proposed list for potential mini bosses with their potential behaviors can be seen here.

Mini bosses would most likely be used in the hidden bonus levels of each world and protect a certain treasure!

### Shadow Tux

Shadow Tux is a dark spirit taking the form of Tux, which spawned from an eerie disease spread by the Ghost Tree. It haunts an ancient library in
the middle of the Corrupted Forest. It mimics Tux's every move but at a delay and will chase after him. Tux must flee from it in a parkour oriented
level segment and avoid getting hit.

### Mimic

The **Mimic** is a large chest holding a sunken treasure which it defends. It stays stationary and throws several obstacles at Tux, such as small
mimics which jump at Tux, trying to bite him. The ship it resits sunk near the tropical islands.
