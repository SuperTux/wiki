</details>

The **Yeti** awaits Tux after the first castle and is the end boss [Icy Island](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Icy-Island).
He is found in the level *No More Mr Ice Guy*.

He is a massive, fuzzy creature preying on Tux in the cold. He may not be the brightest
but proves to be quite a threat when enraged.

#### Attacks

The Yeti will attack the player in two different ways. First, he will rush towards the player,
going from one side to the other. This maneuver is then followed by him stomping three times which
attacks Tux indirectly by making icicles fall down.


### Ghost Tree

*(Note: The Ghost Tree is a work in progress. Although it is unfinished some incomplete graphics
can be found in the game.)*

The Ghost Tree, a large errie, purple tree with deep, dark holes as eyes, is the end boss of
[Rooted Forest](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Rooted-Forest).

Planted by Nolok, the Ghost Tree began spreading a horrible disease through out the forest through
its roots. It has no mind of its own. Its whole purpose is to spread itself and infect the land.

#### Attacks

The Ghost Tree primarily will attack the player from below with its roots, bursting out of the
ground. These can be anticipated by the cracks appearing on the ground. Its other attacks are
depended on which *Ghost Orb* they absorbed prior.

## Planned Bosses

### Toucan

The large and imposing **Toucan**, accompanied by his **Master Totems**, rules over the tropical temples and
is the end boss of [Tropical Paradise](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Tropical-Paradise).

He is very conceited and well spoken, when it is about him. Tux's lack of flight especially brings validation to
his superiority, according to him. However, the Toucan himself is not as much of a threat as he makes out to
be. The true force behind his rule stems from his army of totems, gifted by Nolok in exchange for his loyalty.

### Nolok

See [Nolok](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/Characters#Nolok) for details.

## Mini Bosses

It is yet still unclear if mini bosses are going to be a thing in the actual game. Since entities such as **Shadow Tux**
are confirmed to be added (though not classified as a mini boss at the moment) a proposed list for potential mini bosses
with their potential behaviors can be seen here.

Mini bosses would most likely be used in the hidden bonus levels of each world and protect a certain treasure!

### Giga Ice Crusher/Snowball

A gigantic **Ice Crusher/Snowball** statoined in an outpost between two glaciers to protect a frozen treasure from Tux.
It will chase and try to crush him. Tux must lure them inside a pool of water which later he will freeze to lock it away.

### Stone Golem

An impenetrable **Stone Golem** taken over by Nolok's spell watching the treasures of the ancient ruins. It will try to
smash Tux with its fists and causes rubble to fall on him, too.

### Shadow Tux

**Shadow Tux** is a dark spirit taking the form of Tux, which spawned from an eerie disease spread by the Ghost Tree. It
haunts an ancient library in the middle of the Corrupted Forest. It mimics Tux's every move but at a delay and will chase
after him. Tux must flee from it in a parkour oriented level segment and avoid getting hit.

### Mimic

The **Mimic** is a large chest holding a sunken treasure which it defends. The ship it resits sunk near the tropical islands.
It stays stationary and throws several obstacles at Tux, such as small mimics which jump at Tux, trying to bite him. Tux must
navigate through the ship and activate a trap inside that can crush the mimic.

### Dragon

A small, spiky Dragon guards a firery treasure insde a volcanic core. It will cause the volcano to errupt resulting in a
run for the exit. Along side the rising lava it will shoot fireballs to imped Tux's progress while hovering above him constantly.
