Similar Games
-------------

This is a list of similar games found on the web. And the things they do better than SuperTux (so we can learn from them)

### [Tux Strikes Back](http://www.christian-schaefers.de)

This is a level set for SuperTux 0.1.3. It comes with its own story, levels and world map. Features as quoted from the authors website:

-   explore 18 levels plus a secret bonus level
-   journey through many different locations
-   discover shortcuts and a hidden bonus room
-   fight Nolok's army in a challenging showdown

### [Alex the Allegator](http://allegator.sourceforge.net/)

Jump and Run featuring Alex the Allegator... The game comes in a gameboy-style graphics (4 grey tones, 320x200 or so). Strong points for this game:

-   It tells a story (some cutscenes with music, a bit of text). This really adds to the general atmosphere of the game.
-   The allegator rolling is a unique special idea which brings some cool elements into the game
-   You can play all levels again trying to capture all stars/cherries
-   Nice dynamic music in the background (changing when you die, when the level starts, ...)
-   2 bosses, (1 boss after 5 normal levels) level bring new challenges

### [Secret Maryo Chronicles](http://smclone.sourceforge.net/)

Feels, looks and plays exactly like Super Mario World. Let's hope for them they won't get at Nintendo's radar... Good things in this game:

-   Accelerating and slowing down is slower than in SuperTux, making the levels more challenging (this is a good thing IMO)
-   Some of the blending effects between the levels are nice
-   Their levels are not based on a traditional tile grid, but you can place arbitrary (rectangular) objects in the levels

### [BoboBot](http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/bobobot/)

A game similar in spirit to MegaMan. Although the engine seems limited in a first glance (no scrolling, saving, very small resolution...) the game makes lots of fun because it contains lots of cool ideas and diversities. You see a new enemy, object or graphics every 2 or 3 screens which makes the game interesting.

### [CloneKeen](http://clonekeen.sourceforge.net/)

A Clone of Commander Keen under the GPL.

### [MoleInvasion](http://moleinvasion.tuxfamily.org)

An open source jump and run game. Seems to be heavily inspired by SuperTux and Pingus.

### [Cave Story/Doukutsu](http://www.miraigamer.net/cavestory/)

Brilliant freeware jump and shoot. Featuring very polished music, story, atmosphere. Also shows how good jump and run physics should look like... A Linux version can be found at [1](http://community.livejournal.com/doukutsu/101690.html)
