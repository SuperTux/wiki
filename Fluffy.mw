Fluffy is a penguin that never moulted from his original fluffy feathers, so he looks like a baby penguin. He was teased by other penguins and his only true friend is Tux. He can't run as fast as Tux, but he can jump higher. He would be a second character which the person playing the game could control instead of Tux.
*update instead of higher jump, double jump
