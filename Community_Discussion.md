Why no Linux versions?
======================

This is a Linux game. And yet the only way to install 0.3.x levels on it to build from source code. Please change this!

Iceflower? What iceflower?
==========================

Hey, I read about something called the “iceflower” and I thought it sounded pretty awesome. I have not found it implemented anywhere in SuperTux 0.3.1 and I was wondering, is it just an idea that has been going around or is my version of SuperTux just old? --[MegaTux](mediawiki/Users/megatux) 00:00, 21 March 2010 (UTC)

I got SuperTux from the Ubuntu Karmic Koala software center under the title SuperTux 2. It was the latest version listed. If there is an iceflower, and it is in a newer version of SuperTux, could somebody please ask the Ubuntu packager to upload a more recent version? \\I found ice flower and ice cap graphics in game code, but it isn't implented in the game.

ANSWER - The iceflower is used in one of the levels that can be downloaded in 0.3.1

Add-ons on Ubuntu
=================

I am running Ubuntu Karmic Koala, and the add-on feature is telling me that it is disabled. From what I understand, if you build the source you can enable the feature by installing libcurl3. I do not want to build the source code myself, as with previous experience I have normally destroyed my computer.

I was wondering if and when the package guy will build SuperTux with libcurl3 and add it as a dependency so that other users and I can install add-ons and stuff. --[MegaTux](mediawiki/Users/megatux) 00:02, 21 March 2010 (UTC)

Download it and put it in /.supertux2.

No More Mr. Ice Guy Level Difficulty
====================================

no more mr ice guy is really hard yo beat --[121.209.218.246](Special:Contributions/121.209.218.246 "wikilink") 00:55, 14 July 2011 (UTC)

  
Since you no longer can shoot the Yeti, the level is a bit difficult to beat. But IMO that’s fine for a Boss. --[Bernd](mediawiki/Users/bernd) 17:15, 14 July 2011 (UTC)

Current situation
=================

Lives: 9

Part 1: First 4 lives icicles drop where Tux is.

Part 2: Last 5 lives all icicles fall in a pattern.

Levels difficulty
=================

I'm new here, I've been playing 0.3.1 from fedora repo (i guess), but there's just one small thing that bothered me. The level difficulty is kind of inconstant. You go from a very easy level to a fork of two very hard levels and then the forks go back in (right at the beggining) to a bunch of easy levels, then you advance a lot, until you stop with a bunch of dead-ends of very hard levels, followed again by easier ones. I think level difficulties should be more linear like the easiest first then the harder... Anyway, great game, guys, keep it up... Also, the forest map is quite nice, like, less mario-clone and more original content...

Music
=====

Helloes, I have two MIDI songs that I would like to contribute to SuperTux. Unfortunately, their file type (.mid) is not allowed for upload on the wiki, and I'm not interested in joining a file-sharing service. Any suggestions? [Tuxnut](mediawiki/Users/tuxnut) 23:44, 14 June 2010 (UTC)

  
Compress them as .zip or .gz and upload them on the [\[Template:Mediawiki:Bugtracker-url]([Template:Mediawiki:Bugtracker-url "wikilink") bug tracker\] in a new bug under “Sound and Music.” --[Mathnerd314](mediawiki/Users/mathnerd314) 00:16, 15 June 2010 (UTC)

The bug tracker. I'm seeing a lot of bugs marked “new” and only a few marked “resolved” -\_- [TUX/√UT](mediawiki/Users/tuxnut "wikilink") ([plz talk 2 me internets](User_talk:Tuxnut "wikilink") | [view horrendous deeds](Special:Contributions/Tuxnut)) 19:34, 20 June 2010 (UTC)

  
Most of the new “bugs” are people dumping their files there. What do you axpect the devs to do with them? Reject them would not be a smart move by pissing of users. Accept won't work either because how can you acept leves if noone knows what features are available in milestone 2. But yes, all the noise on the bugtracker sucks. I think about unsubscribing. --[87.118.104.203](Special:Contributions/87.118.104.203 "wikilink") 19:35, 21 June 2010 (UTC)

  
Everyone with Subversion installed knows what features are available in Milestone 2. And of course, since these user levels are submitted by users, and only developer-made levels are decent, it naturally has to be pure junk, right? [TUX/√UT](mediawiki/Users/tuxnut "wikilink") ([plz talk 2 me internets](User_talk:Tuxnut "wikilink") | [view horrendous deeds](Special:Contributions/Tuxnut)) 03:20, 22 June 2010 (UTC)

  
Many of the features in svn are tagged as “to be removed” in the wiki. Maybe you missed that while reformatting the entries. See [Grumbel grumbles](Grumbel_grumbles "wikilink") for

which levels are consider junk by the main developer. But you probably know that already. --[173.244.197.210](Special:Contributions/173.244.197.210 "wikilink") 16:36, 22 June 2010 (UTC)

  
  
I found this: *Trash, junk and other garbage and we call it 'levels'. The svn needs really some large cleanup to seperate the useless testing stuff from the usefull \[sic\] ones and the testing from the actually playable.*

I believe he is talking more about the test/experimental levels included in the SVN (Bouncy Coils and Crumbling Path, e.g.) than the user-submitted content. But that's enough of this semi-trivial discussion; this bickering (especially on my part) is not why I created this section.

Frame Delay Time?
=================

Hello, I'm new here, and I need to know the correct delay (in ms) between frames of a animation, as in a sprite. I've searched the source code, but there seems to be too much to sift through. Can anyone help me? --[1a2a3a2a1a](mediawiki/Users/1a2a3a2a1a)

  
Never mind, found it. (10 fps, or 100 ms) --[1a2a3a2a1a](mediawiki/Users/1a2a3a2a1a)

Screen Res?
===========

just installed SuperTux on my mac. the screen resolution is wrong, how can i change this?

  
Use `--geometry WIDTHxHEIGHT`, as `supertux2 --help` should show. --[Mathnerd314](mediawiki/Users/mathnerd314) 15:30, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

Cannot delete levels
--------------------

Hi, I have linux. I have recently been in the leveleditor and made some of my own levels. But, whenever I say 'don't save' to a level that I just made, it appears in the 'bonus level' section. I think I have the first version where the evil penguin-guy takes Penny so I think it's the first one. Please help. I hope you understand what I just said!

  
Your levels should be in `~/.supertux/levels`. Find the ones you don't want and delete them, and rename the rest so that they go in numerical order.

Cave levels
-----------

I like the cave levels in the Icyisland world – finally, we get some contrast in the theme – but it really doesn't fit into the plot very well. Why would Tux want to enter an ice cave if he could simply go over or around it to get to Nolok's castle?

Here is one of the many ways to incorporate the cave levels into SuperTux:

  
Tux first visits Nolok's castle, but realizes that nobody can enter without the key, which is located in the ice cave. Tux enters the ice cave, going deeper and deeper into the crystal mines (this is where Incubator Island levels like Crystal Beauty come in handy) until he finds the key. Then he escapes and enters the castle.

I don't know. As long as there's an explanation that works, I'm happy with it. [TUX/√UT](mediawiki/Users/tuxnut "wikilink") ([plz talk 2 me internets](User_talk:Tuxnut "wikilink") | [view horrendous deeds](Special:Contributions/Tuxnut)) 18:49, 4 September 2010 (UTC)

Profile folder
--------------

With SuperTux 0.3.3 on Windows, it possible to consolidate the profile folder (user/application data/supertux2) into the Program Files/SuperTux folder so that all the files are in one place? [70.41.197.99](Special:Contributions/70.41.197.99 "wikilink") 04:02, 19 December 2010 (UTC)

Hi im new here. How do you make bosses or worldmaps?

I would like more quality and more quantity of bonus levels (in order of preference if you only have the resources to do one or the other.) -- Qwood [(contribs)](Special:Contributions/Qwood "wikilink") [(talk)](User_talk:Qwood "wikilink") 02:38, 7 June 2011 (UTC)

Nomad animation for Forest World?
=================================

Super Tux should have an Nomad animation for Forest World. Could you want Nomad to have an animation, and to support video files for AVI? Ariel and Times New Roman have OpenType Features for ligatures which support Arabic and Marathi languages.

As this is an open wiki, I see little reason for the <mediawiki/Users/bugmenot> account to exist.

New Supertux Snapshot
=====================

Isn't it time to create a new snapshot of supertux (game and editor). For most it is to difficult to install the latest version of the game. Isn't it possible to create a current snapshot (every 4 months).

  
Feel free to take a screenshot and post it! -- Qwood [(contribs)](Special:Contributions/Qwood "wikilink") [(talk)](User_talk:Qwood "wikilink") 22:09, 3 July 2011 (UTC)

  
I would do it by myself, but I can't. I have never managed to build the latest version with all existing new files. I think that for most of the devolper it's easy (easier than for me!) to create a new snapshot, so why not?!

  
If you have problems building the new version, you should ask for help. Honestly, if you can't build the new version then a screenshot isn't very useful to you anyway :/ -- Qwood [(contribs)](Special:Contributions/Qwood "wikilink") [(talk)](User_talk:Qwood "wikilink") 22:22, 4 July 2011 (UTC)

  
Hm...I don't know what you want to say. Maybe I don't know the correct meaning of “snapshot”. I thought that someone who has the current version of the game, could upload his supertux folder or better an exe-file or something like that...

  
I thought you meant a screenshot :) Of course a snapshot is different, you're correct. -- Qwood [(contribs)](Special:Contributions/Qwood "wikilink") [(talk)](User_talk:Qwood "wikilink") 21:16, 5 July 2011 (UTC)

  
I've tried to install the current version: I've downloaded a development version of supertux from here <http://supertux.lethargik.org/download.html> (0.3.3b for windows) and OpenAL. It works. But i wanna have all the new files. So I've downloaded VisualSVN from here <http://www.visualsvn.com/server/download/>. Where can I add the command “svn checkout <http://supertux.lethargik.org/svn/supertux/trunk/supertux>” which is explained here <http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Download/Subversion>?

  
You need to make a new folder somewhere, right click on it, and select something from the context menu along the lines of “Check Out Here.” I used VisualSVN a long time ago but I don't remember what the exact menu option was. -- Qwood [(contribs)](Special:Contributions/Qwood "wikilink") [(talk)](User_talk:Qwood "wikilink") 14:46, 7 July 2011 (UTC)

  
I created a new repository and then a new folder. But I can't find “Check Out here” or something like that. There are the following options: Copy URL to Clipboard, Browse, Properties, New/Folder, New/Project Structure,...

  
You actually don't want to be using VisualSVN (I don't think.) Try [TortiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/) which is what I remember using. -- Qwood [(contribs)](Special:Contributions/Qwood "wikilink") [(talk)](User_talk:Qwood "wikilink") 16:30, 7 July 2011 (UTC)

I must say, compiling software is a heck of a lot simpler on Linux. “tar, cd, make” -- Qwood [(contribs)](Special:Contributions/Qwood "wikilink") [(talk)](User_talk:Qwood "wikilink") 16:34, 7 July 2011 (UTC)

I use ppa:supertux-dev/daily. It isn't daily, but every 3 months or so.

Is there a active Supertux forum? All forums linked from the wiki are dead. On facebook are several Supertux groups, bot none seems to be official or even active.
