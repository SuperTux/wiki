= Introduction =
Most animated images you see in supertux are '''sprites'''. Sprite definitions are defined in individual files that end in ".sprite", e.g. "data/images/creatures/snowball.sprite", and follow [[S-expr]] syntax.

= Example =

 (supertux-sprite
   (action
     (name "left")
     (hitbox 2 4 31.8 31.8)
     (images "left-0.png"
             "left-1.png"
             "left-2.png")
   )
   (action
     (name "right")
     (hitbox 2 4 31.8 31.8)
     (mirror-action "left")
   )
   (action
     (name "squished-left")
     (hitbox 1 -19 31.8 31.8)
     (images "squished-left.png")
   )
   (action
     (name "squished-right")
     (hitbox 1 -19 31.8 31.8)
     (mirror-action "squished-left")
   )
 )

Let's look at the sprite "snowball": 

A sprite consists of a set of '''actions'''. An action is simply an animation composed from several images. The engine can render a sprite and change it's currently displayed action. The snowball sprite, for example, contains 4 actions named "left", "right", "squished-left" and "squished-right". 
 
Additionally you can define animation speed ('''fps''' <n>) and a hitbox ('''hitbox''' <x> <y> <w> <h>). 

The hitbox offset indicates where the "origin" of the sprite is: If the engine draws a sprite at position 50,50 then <x> will be substracted from the x coordinate and <y> will be substraced from the y-coordinate.
The hitbox size will get read by most sprites' gamecode to set the width and height of an imaginary rectangle that defines what parts of a sprite are solid.

== (sprite) block ==
The sprite description file is [[S-expr]] based. A sprite description starts with a ''(sprite)'' list, It should then contain a name entry ''(name "myname")'' and then several ''(action)'' entries (at least 1).

== (action) block ==
The action block contains then the name of an action ''(name "myaction")'' can optionally contain an ''(hitbox <x> <y> <w> <h>)'' block. It's also possible to add an ''(fps number)'' block to define the number of frames played per second. Finnaly comes a list of ''(images)'' or the '(mirror-action "actionname")'' keyword which will take an already defined action and flip all it's images vertically.

= Adding Own Sprites / Testing =

You can easily add your own sprites by creating a custom .sprite file and placing it somewhere appropriate, e.g. "data/creatures/<name>/<name>.sprite" for badguys or "data/objects/<name>/<name>.sprite" for game objects. Now you probably want to test your sprite. This is easily possible from the game [[Console]] (example for data/images/creatures/yeti/yeti.sprite):

  testsprite<-FloatingImage("images/creatures/yeti/yeti.sprite")
  testsprite.fade_in(1)
  testsprite.set_action("run-left")

To remove the sprite from your screen, use

  testsprite<-null

An alternative would be creating ScriptedObjects in the leveleditor and selecting your spritefile
