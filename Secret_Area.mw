The Secret Area Trigger is used to mark secret areas, at the moment it doesn't do more then writing a message, it however could also be used to count the number of secrets the player has found in a world (even so that is probally better done with special coins or items to collect).

== Proposal ==

Grumbel: Instead of just writing a lame message I propose to let the Secret Area Trigger also fade a away a tilemap, ie.:

* you enter a secret area
* the engine fades away the tilemap named "secret"
* you can now actually see the secret area
* you leave the secret area
* the engine fades in the "secret" tilemap back into place

Secret Areas thus become much more visual and look much less like bugs in the map, it also no longer needed to run blindly through secret areas.

=== Problems ===

* levels need to be changed, that would basically mean to move tiles from "foreground" to the new "secret" tilemap, some editor support to quickly copy&paste tiles from one map to another might ease this a lot
* rectangular tiletriggers might not be flexible enough, to solve this I would propose a trigger tilemap containing numbers, 0 is "no trigger" and each number refers to a different trigger "trigger N", ie. 1 could stand as secret trigger and would thus cause the fadeaway of the secret tilemap while other values might be used for other buildin or custom triggers. A tilemap would allow to map out the exact area of a secret area, instead of just an approximation, which might not be enough for fade aways. To still allow the counting of secret areas a tilemap approach would either require from the level designer to mark different secret areas with different special tiles or require that the engine can figure out itself which secret areas tiles are connected to each other and thus assign them an id automatically.
* when secret areas are to close to each other also non discovered areas might be revealed due to the fade-away, a simple solution would be to just move the secret areas further away from each other, a more general solution would be the addition of a (tilemap "secret2") tag to mark which tilemap should fade away, that however should only be used in very few situations if ever, but since support might be easy to add it shouldn't hurt to much
