* After Starting supertux CPU usage is 100% and mouse and keyboard aren't working in SuperTux. OpenAL reports that it couldn't open /dev/snd. If you are using dmix with alsa add this to ~/.openalrc
 (define devices '(alsa))
 (define alsa-out-device "output")
 (define sampling-rate 44100)
 (define speaker-num 2)

After this SuperTux should work as normal. And you can now play all other games that uses OpenAl while you are listening to the music.

== OpenAL ==

By default OpenAL uses OSS output. On modern systems OSS is emulated by Alsa anyway, so usually using
Alsa directly sounds better. Create ~/.openalrc:

 (define devices '(alsa))
 (define speaker-num 2)
 (define alsa-out-device default)

=== strange ./configure error ===

If ./configure bails out with
"configure: error: /bin/sh mk/autoconf/config.sub i686-pc-linux-oldld failed"
this will most probably mean you forgot to install g++ (hence -oldld instead of -gnu). Install (a recent version of) g++ and you're good to go.
