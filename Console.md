The Console is a panel normally hidden from view. Its usage is
twofold:

- It displays informational, warning and error messages that occur
  during gameplay, alerting players of things like low diskspace,
  broken levels, â€¦
- It helps debug the engine and test levels by allowing direct
  execution of Squirrel script commands (see [Scripting
  reference](Scripting_reference "wikilink"))

The Console pops into view for a short time whenever new messages are
printed. To review old messages and enter commands, the console needs to
be activated.

To do so, you will have to start SuperTux in [[Developer Mode]].
The key assigned to opening the console can be changed in the
keyboard setup as soon it is activated. The default key is `` ` `` (the
one with the `~` on it) or `^` on German keyboard layout).

In order to make this permanent without the usage of command line parameters,
follow the guide in [[Developer Mode]].

Commands
--------

Following is a list of predefined scripts to run in the console:

| Command           | Description
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------
| flip()            | Flips the current level vertically. Make sure you have something to stand on!
| edit()            | Puts the level into a state suitable for testing out edits. Tux can't exit the level; if he dies or reaches the end he goes into ghost mode.
| play()            | Goes out of edit mode and restarts the level.
| kill()            | Kills Tux
| grow()            | Grows Tux into big Tux
| shrink()          | Shrinks Tux into little Tux
| fire()            | Gives Tux the fire powerup
| ice()             | Gives Tux the ice powerup
| earth()           | Gives Tux the earth powerup
| lifeup()          | Gives Tux 100 more coins
| finish()          | Finish the current level
| worldmapfinish()  | Finish all the levels on the worldmap
| functions(x)      | Gives a list of the functions available in an object or table. If no argument is given, this prints out the functions in the root table.

There are many more, see [ScriptingGlobals](ScriptingGlobals "wikilink")
for the full list of utility functions and [Scripting
reference](Scripting_reference "wikilink") for all the interesting
things you can do.

Console Features
----------------

The console currently supports autocomplete, through use of the tab key,
line editing with left/right/home/end/delete keys, and viewing past
messages using the up, down, page up, and page down keys. To run a
command, simply press the enter or return key.
