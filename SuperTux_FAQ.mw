==When will the next version of SuperTux be released?==

This is by far the most frequently asked question of all, and the answer is simple:

'''When it's done.'''

Honestly, we don't have a release date yet. Just like many of you, we'd like to see SuperTux finished and released to the public as soon as possible, but since we all are busy with other, probably less interesting things, the amount of time we are able to put into this game is limited. Please be patient.

== What's new in SuperTux 0.3? ==

Most information on these Wiki pages is about what's new in SuperTux 0.3. Just browse around, and feel free to add your own ideas. :-)

== SuperTux 0.3.1? 0.1.3? Subversion? ==

Please see our [[Versioning scheme]] page.

== How can I get in touch with you? ==

Depending on who you want to reach - and for what purpose - you can either join our [[IRC Channel]] or write to one of the [[Mailing Lists]]. Please note that, due to massive amounts of spam, we had to set the mailing lists to subscribers-only. If you send emails to the lists and are not subscribed then you will get an automated reply saying that your message is waiting for approval, but it's very likely that we will miss your e-mail in all the spam (we're very sorry about that), so better subscribe before posting to the list.

== Can I help? ==

You most certainly can.
* Creating game content in form of graphics, sound, music and levels (See [[Contributing]])
* Writing code for new features
* Work on the story and the settings
There's many things to be done - even besides actually creating game content:
* Post good ideas to the wiki (See [[Ideas]])
* Help keeping these pages up-to-date and free of spam (See [[Special:Recentchanges]])
* Proofread and improve the program's and the levels' translation (See [[Translation]])
* Test the game on a variety of platforms (please read [[#I found a bug in the developer version!|I found a bug in the developer version!]] first) (See [[Bugs]])
* Write and/or maintain documentation for users and developers (See [[User Manual]] and [[Game Engine]])

 
If you want to help, just get in touch (see [[#How can I get in touch with you?|How can I get in touch with you?]]) and ask.

== Is there a preview of the next SuperTux version? ==

Yes. [[Milestone 1.9]] is a snapshot of SuperTux without certain buggy features. There are currently Windows and Linux installers.

== I found a bug in the developer version! ==

Well, that's not really a question, but great anyway. Keep in mind, however, that SuperTux is bound to have lots of bugs at this stage of development. Actually, chances are quite high that a particular bug is already known but not yet fixed because we just didn't have the time yet.

If you find a bug you think has escaped our attention, make sure you have as much information about when it occurred as possible. This might include steps to reproduce the bug, constellations where the bug won't show, a backtrace of the call stack if you got an exception (use a debugger for this), etc. Then add an entry to the [{{MediaWiki:Bugtracker-url}} bugtracker].

== I'm thinking about buying SuperTux. ==

If you have paid for SuperTux, you have been ripped off. Supertux is available for free download at [[Download/Installation]]. An equivalent Live CD, to be downloaded free of charge, is under development at time of writing. If you ''want'' to pay for SuperTux, you can make a donation, which would be highly appreciated, but we're not making you pay.
