About This Page
===============

This document is work in progress; when finished, its purpose is to
provide a final design paper for SuperTux Milestone 2. General ideas
go into their respective areas on the [game design](game_design
"wikilink") pages. Please **do not** change anything on this page that
hasn't been discussed and approved by the developers!

[Milestone 1 Analysis](Milestone_1_Analysis "wikilink")
=======================================================

Milestone 2 will try to correct many things that were considered “bad”
while retaining most things that were considered considered “good” in
[Milestone 1](Milestone_1 "wikilink"). See [Milestone 1
Analysis](Milestone_1_Analysis "wikilink") for a detailed analysis.

[Game Engine](Game_Engine "wikilink")
=====================================

SuperTux Milestone 2 will use OpenGL to draw the graphics. The
features of this library will be used to enhance gameplay and visual
content in several ways:

- Create dark levels that are illuminated only in certain areas (for
  example around Tux, lamps, lava, certain badguys etc.), see
  [Lighting](Lighting "wikilink")
- Colored blocks that are only visible when in the range of a light
  source with the same color, see [Lighting](Lighting "wikilink")
- Add atmosphere to levels using different lighting
- Zooming (in cutscenes)
- Make foreground translucent when Tux walks behind it

New Design Document
===================

Most of this page has been moved to Milestone 3. See [Milestone 2
Design Document](Milestone_2_Design_Document "wikilink") for details
on the current Milestone 2 plan.

[World 2](World_2 "wikilink")
=============================

After finishing Antarctica by beating the worlds boss, a cutscene,
replacing the currently displayed text, will be shown. (For a detailed
description of cutscenes, see section “Story”.) Tux will then advance
to [World 2](World_2 "wikilink"), the forest island. Its worldmap will
be built using the same, possibly enhanced, format that Antarctica
uses. The worldmap will be designed as follows: The island consists of
four sections. A light friendly looking forest where Tux starts his
journey, a ghost forest section, and a transition between them; in the
center of the island, surrounded by the ghost forest is the world's
castle, called Dark Forest Keep. Levels will be spread throughout the
whole island, distributed as follows: 50 per cent of the levels are
inside the light section, 30 per cent inside the haunted section, with
one or two levels inside the transition area. The remaining 20 per
cent will take place inside the castle.

The primary goal of the forest world is to beat the boss at the final
castle level. In order to get there, Tux needs to collect five keys
scattered throughout the island which will open the door to the
castle. Thus, the paths on the worldmap should lead into five
dead-ends that hold the levels in which the key can be found. The path
to the castle is accessible from after the first level. However, when
Tux tries to enter the castle, he can't unlock the door without all
five keys.

Levels
======

Unlike Antarctica, forest levels can have variable sizes, both
horizontally and vertically. In addition to that, levels can have a
number of different sectors of variable size, connected by doors,
portals, script events and spawn points. Due to this variability,
there is no recommended level size anymore; the “perfect size” of a
level solely depends on its design. The three different themes on
forest world -light forest, ghost forest and castle- are each
represented by a matching tileset. All forest levels use one of these
tilesets; a general rule should be not to mix them.

Levels have the ability to autoscroll in all four directions. There is
no fixed ending sequence like in Antarctica anymore; level designers
can use scripts to determine the ending conditions of a level. The
most common level endings will be:

- reaching a goal area somewhere in the level,
- picking up a special item (for example, one of the five keys),
- killing a certain badguy or boss.

Milestone 2 levels will try to focus on a certain theme to make each
level unique in gameplay. Level events can be automated using scripts
in order to create in-game cutscenes.

Worldmap
--------

Other than on the Antarctica worldmap, the levels should be placed on
different paths, so that there is always a choice between at least two
levels. Exceptions to this (i.e. levels with no alternative to choose
from) are

- the first level,
- levels on one path that are in some way connected by story,
- the (first) transition to the ghost forest section, and
- the castle levels.

Light Forest
------------

Levels:

- Theme introduction and tutorial on new abilities
- Moving platforms
- Trampolines
- Autoscrolling
- Falling rocks
- Portable boxes, stacking
- Vertically flipped level

Ghost Forest
------------

Intro: Nolok is using some heavy magic in the castle, this will have
an effect to the levels around the castle. The forest there turned
into a ghost forest. Stuff will look spooky and surreal things can
happen.

Gameplay: You can think of the ghost world as a 2nd dimension next to
the forest. There will be some game elements that allow a transition
between these 2 dimensions (or force that transition). We will also
start playing with colors and light effects in the ghost forest parts.
Transitions between the dimensions can happen by:

- actively walking through a portal,
- being beamed into the other world without warning, using invisible triggers, or
- being caught by special badguys (willowisp) that have the ability to
  carry you over to the other world.

Levels:

- Light forest to ghost forest transition, theme introduction (two levels)
- Cannons and dispensers
- Spiders

Castle
------

- Main Hall: Theme introduction
- First Floor: Labyrinth, light switch blocks
- Tower: Rising Lava
- Attic: Boss battle

[Actions](Actions "wikilink")
=============================

Powerups
--------

In Milestone 2 in general, the favourite way of enhancing Tux'
abilities will be through level objects that temporarily grant Tux
special abilities (see Level Objects section for more details), rather
than permanent powerups like fire and ice shots. Those will still be
there, but they'll remain relatively weak, so they don't get in the
way of level design. An ice shot will be implemented, the fire shot's
behaviour will be improved \[need more detail here\]. The fire shot
gets a new ability to burn through specific tiles to reveal paths.
These paths, however, should contain only bonus items like coins; it
must be possible to finish a level without needing the fire powerup.

- Ice shot
- Fire melts ice, ice freezes water
- Super Buttjump (timed)

General idea: More level objects than powerups, they can be placed
where they are needed. Powers like fire must not get in the way of
level design

Permanent Abilities (for Big Tux)
---------------------------------

- Butt Jump
- Backflip

Level Objects
=============

- Coin - collect 100 coins to get an extra life.
- Bonus Block - contains powerups.
- Message Box - a special bonus block that contains a message. Implemented as telephones.
- Ambient Sound - plays a looping sound effect inside the defined range.
- Timer - adds a time limit to a level.
- Particle System - adds background visual effects like clouds, snow, and rain.
- Door - respawns Tux at a defined spawn point when activated.
- Spawn Point - defines the place where Tux appears after walking through a door.
- Bell - When touched, Tux respawns at the bell after dying.
- Trampoline - Tux can jump on them for a very high jump; can be carried around.
- Falling Block - solid block that falls down shortly after being touched.
- Powerup - an object that represents a powerup, such as egg, flower, star, extra life, or potion.
- Message Trigger - display a message as soon as Tux enters their range. Used to mark secret areas.
- Sequence Trigger - executes a script on contact.
- Moving Platform - \[still needs to be defined.\]
- Carryable Block - Blocks that can be carried around and stacked.
- Bubble Dispenser - Releases bubbles that Tux can use to travel upwards.
- Ice Cube/Straw Block - a block that can be destroyed by the fire shot. Appearance depends on the world it's used in.
