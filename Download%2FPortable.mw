'''SuperTux Portable''' aims to allow users to play SuperTux on embedded devices such as PDAs, the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or low-CPU PCs. This page is meant to collect ideas for a possible 'low spec SuperTux'.

== Devices ==

=== Palm OS ===

* Display: 320x320, 320x480 or 160x160, 65536 colors (Palm IIIc = 256 colors)
* sound
* Palm OS 5+ <=> ARM processors, 126 - 416 MHz
* 2 - 100 MB internal memory
* flash cards

=== ========== ===

* Resolution: can vary greatly. One should develop it so the screen range varies (scaling is also an option, but that should be avoided) -- it doesn't necessarily affect gameplay. For reference, I believe 180x170 is the norm for LCDs, but can get much bigger for the most advanced ones that offer PDA abilities. Monochrome phones use LED screens that offer like 1/3rd of the others screens -- they should be provided with a smaller graphics version (the resolution is smaller, but since the display is bigger, smaller graphics will not look like ants, but will do ok.)
* Controlls: 0-9 keypad, plus two buttons (* and +). Controls shouldn't be hardcoded, but rather use defined variables like LEFT_KEY, POWER_KEY, etc. There is also a button to go for the menu, and usually another to terminate the application right away (these two cannot be caught by the program for obvious reasons).
* Programming Language: Java. (some mobile phones, like Nokias, do provide C. it should be avoided because it would not be portable or easily installable.)
* Notes: due to the Java requirement this might need an extra version. Another issue is that cellulars don't seem to be able to report two key strokes at once -- this makes it impossible to jump and move at the same time, which is quite frustrating. Using diagonal keys might prove to be good enough.

=== Game Boy Advance ===

* Resolution: 240x160
* Graphics: Mode0 provides 4 tilemap layers and 128 sprites, tiles are 8x8 and you can have either 256 colors per tile and 256 tiles or 16 colors per tile and 512 tiles on a map
* Controls: DPad, A, B, Start, Select, L, R
* Programming Language: C, Assembler

=== Nintendo DS ===

* Resolution: 256x192
* Graphics: ???
* Controls: DPad, A, B, X, Y, Start, Select, L, R, Touchscreen
* Programming Language: C, Assembler

=== GP32x ===

* Resolution: 320x240
* Graphics: plain framebuffer
* Controls: DPad, A, B, Start, Select, L, R
* Programming Language: C, Assembler

=== GP3X ===

* Resolution: 320x240
* Graphics: plain framebuffer, has SDL available
* Controls: DPad, A, B, X, Y, Start, Select, L, R, Vol-, Vol+, Extra button by depressing DPad
* Programming Language: C
* Note: runs a Linux-based system, so we can use any Linux tools that can be recompiled for it.
* Port is in development [www.gp2x.de/cgi-bin/cfiles.cgi?0,0,0,0,46,1199] (Elektranox), continued as [archive.gp2x.de/cgi-bin/cfiles.cgi?0,0,0,0,35,1454] (scachi)

=== Playstation Portable ===

* Resolution: 480 x 272
* Graphics: ???
* Controls: DPad, Cross, Circle, Square, Triangle, Start, Select, L, R, Analog-Stick
* Programming Language: C, C++, Lua, Python, Assembler
* Notes: Resolution is to small for double-sprite size, yet to large for 32x16 sprites, maybe need something inbetween. Firmware can cause problems.

An [[Download/Installation#PlayStation Portable .28PSP.29|unofficial port of version 0.1.3 for the PSP]] has already been created. Also see [http://forums.qj.net/showthread.php?t=31140 here].

=== PDA, Zaurus ===

* Resolution: 640x480 (high-end Zs ONLY), 320x240 (5500 series Z models - FAR more common)
* Graphics: (Framebuffer?)
* Controls: Touchscreen, four-way dpad, (one button?), mini-qwerty based keyboard?
* Programming Language: (C?)

0.1.1 was ported to the 640x480 Zauruses: www.killefiz.de/zaurus/showdetail.php?app=2759

UPDATE: 0.1.1 version has been replaced by 0.1.2 version at www.elsix.org/index.php?w=project&p=supertux

=== PC ===

* Speed: game should be able to run on a Pentium 90Mhz CPU
* Resolution: 320x240, possible an additional 'scaled mode' with 640x480 for double sprite and tile size
* Controls: Gamepad with unknown number of buttons, at least 2 or Keyboard

== Implementation ==

The development should start on the GBA, since that is the device with the lowest, but still quite usable specs. World of Warcraft The tiles in the game would be 16x16, so large Tux would be 32x16 large, half the size it was in Milestone1. Due to the tile and screen size, the visible on screen area would be equivalent to a 480x320 window in Milestone1, ie. smaller then that in Milestone1, but normal for GBA games.
