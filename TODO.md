This is a centralized list of things that need to be done. It is
maintained by the SuperTux development team. It can include issues
that are outstanding, or resource requests. The document will also be
used to track decisions on these issues and requests.

Please have a look at our issue tracker on GitHub where you can also
find issues by `category:` tags (e.g.: `category:design` for
graphics/UX tasks, `category:code` for code tasks, and
`category:levels` for level design tasks).

> **Note:** This TODO is not to be used blindly. Use your brain and
  figure out which feature is most important and most practical to
  implement. Don't chase pie-in-the-sky ideas that you'll never get
  done. Also be aware that some of the items listed here might be out
  of date or not good ideas to begin with.
