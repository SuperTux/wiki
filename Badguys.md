A badguy in SuperTux is a foe of Tux, serving as Nolok's minion. They may not be "bad" in the way that a snowball isn't really bad, but they can certainly hurt Tux. Most of the badguys are creatures, like Snowballs with varying characteristics, but some are more like objects (Stalactite for example) or phenomena like Flame.

Tux will try to avoid approaching badguys if possible. If he runs into one or one drops on his head, he is hurt. When hurt Tux will lose a powerup or, if Tux has no powerups left, he will be killed.

Many of the badguys Tux can knock out by jumping on them and squishing them. Others are only stunned by this for a short while or are insusceptible to this and hurt Tux instead. As a rule of thumb, badguys with a spiky head or helmet can usually not be jumped on.

For a list of the game's badguys and their properties take a look at the badguy categories below.
