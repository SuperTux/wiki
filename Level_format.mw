The level format is a bit complex, which is why the [[Editor FAQ|level editor]] can prove itself very useful. If you are interested in how the levels look like or want to edit them manually (and find some of the parameters not self-explanatory enough), then you may read or skim through this section.

=== Badguys ===
This section describes the various badguys and their parameters.

The next few sections describe the extra parameters for the other badguys.

==== Common parameters ====
<pre>(&lt;badguy-name&gt;
  (x 270)                 ;; The badguy's X coordinate.
  (y 126)                 ;; The badguy's Y coordinate. (Note that the origin is in the top-left corner!)
  (dead-script "
// A squirrel script that is executed once the badguy dies. Optional.
")
  (direction "auto")      ;; Direction in which the badguy will move after spawning. "left", "right" or "auto".
                          ;; Optional (except with some badguys).
)
</pre>

Angry Stones, Bouncing Snowballs, Fish, Flying Snowballs, Ghost Trees, Igels, Jumpies, Moles, Mr Bombs, Mr Iceblocks, Mr Rockets, Mr Trees, Plants, Poison Ivies, Skullyhops, Snails, Snowballs, Spider Mites, Spikies, Sleeping Spikies, Stalactites, Stumpies, Toads, Totems, Yeti Stalactites, Walking Leaves, Yetis and Zeeklings only require this list of parameters. Simply substitute <tt><badguy-name></tt> with one of the following:

*<tt>fish</tt>
*<tt>flyingsnowball</tt>
*<tt>ghosttree</tt>

*<tt>mole</tt>
*<tt>mrbomb</tt>
*<tt>mriceblock</tt>
*<tt>mrrocket</tt>
*<tt>mrtree</tt>
*<tt>plant</tt>
*<tt>poisonivy</tt>
*<tt>skullyhop</tt>
*<tt>snail</tt>
*<tt>snowball</tt>

*<tt>totem</tt>
*<tt>yeti</tt>
*<tt>yeti_stalactite</tt>
*<tt>walkingleaf</tt>
*<tt>zeekling</tt>

==== Dart trap ====
<pre>(darttrap
  (initial-delay 3)       ;; How long to wait after being activated before starting to shoot?
  (fire-delay 3)          ;; How long to wait between shots?
  (ammo -1)               ;; How many shots do we have? (-1 is infinity)
  (direction "left")      ;; This common parameter is NOT optional with the dart trap.
)</pre>

==== Dispenser ====
<pre>(dispenser
  (cycle 3)               ;; How often should a badguy be dispensed?
  
  (badguy random)         ;; Valid values are "snowball", "bouncingsnowball", "mrbomb",
                          ;; "mriceblock", "mrrocket", "poisonivy", "skullyhop", "snail", or "random".
)</pre>

==== Flame ====
<pre>(flame
  (radius 3)              ;; How big should the radius of the circle be that the flame
                          ;; follows?
  
  (speed 10)              ;; How fast should the flame be?
)</pre>

==== Lightning orb ====
The lightning orb (<tt>kugelblitz</tt>) ignores the <tt>y</tt> coordinate, spawning above the visible screen.

==== Mr. Rocket ====
<tt>direction</tt> is not optional.

==== Spike ====
Don't mistake this badguy for Spiky! Spiky is the snowball-like creature with spikes, whilst a spike is an object serving the same purpose like the stalactite.

<pre>(spike
  (direction 2)           ;; 0: north, 1: south, 2: west, 3: east
)</pre>

==== Will-o-Wisp ====
<pre>(willowisp
  (sector "main")         ;; Sector to teleport player into when touched
  (spawnpoint "willo1")   ;; Spawnpoint to teleport player to
  (name "wisp1")          ;; Name for scripting control
  (flyspeed 3)            ;; Speed at which wisp flies towards player
  (track-range 30)        ;; How near must the player be to be followed?
  (vanish-range 60)       ;; How far must the player be for the wisp to vanish?
  (running #f)            ;; Should we follow a preset path?
  (path
    ;; Path to follow if running is true. See the path in camera-config for the syntax.
