The level format is a bit complex, which is why [http://flexlay.berlios.de/ Flexlay] can prove itself very useful as an editor. If you are interested in how the levels look like or want to edit them manually (and find some of the parameters not self-explanatory enough), then you may read or skim through this section.

=== Badguys ===
This section describes the various badguys and their parameters.

The next few sections describe the extra parameters for the other badguys.

==== Common parameters ====
<pre>(&lt;badguy-name&gt;
  (x 270)                 ;; The badguy's X coordinate.
  (y 126)                 ;; The badguy's Y coordinate. (Note that the origin is in the top-left corner!)
  (stay-on-platform #f)   ;; Optional. Should the badguy do its best not to fall from the platform it's on? (NYI)
)
</pre>

Bouncing Snowballs, Flying Snowballs, Jumpies, Mr Bombs, Mr Iceblocks, Mr Rockets, Mr Trees, World 1 Noloks, Poison Ivies, Snowballs, Spikies, Stalactites, Yeti Stalactites and Zeeklings only require this list of parameters. Simply substitute <tt><badguy-name></tt> with one of the following:

*<tt>bouncingsnowball</tt>
*<tt>flyingsnowball</tt>
*<tt>jumpy</tt>
*<tt>mrbomb</tt>
*<tt>mriceblock</tt>
*<tt>mrrocket</tt>
*<tt>mrtree</tt>
*<tt>nolok_01</tt>
*<tt>poisonivy</tt>
*<tt>snowball</tt>
*<tt>snowsnail</tt>
*<tt>spidermite</tt>
*<tt>spiky</tt>
*<tt>stalactite</tt>
*<tt>yeti_stalactite</tt>
*<tt>zeekling</tt>

==== Dispenser ====
<pre>(dispenser
  (cycle 3)               ;; How often should a badguy be dispensed?
  
  (badguy random)         ;; Valid values are "snowball", "bouncingsnowball", "mrbomb",
                          ;; "mriceblock", "mrrocket", "poisonivy", "snowsnail", or "random".
)</pre>

==== Flame ====
<pre>(flame
  (radius 3)              ;; How big should the radius of the circle be that the flame
                          ;; follows?
  
  (speed 10)              ;; How fast should the flame be?
)</pre>

==== Lightning orb ====
The lightning orb ("kugelblitz") ignores the <tt>y</tt> coordinate, spawning above the visible screen.

==== Spike ====
Don't mistake this badguy for Spiky! Spiky is the snowball-like creature with spikes, whilst a spike is an object serving the same purpose like the stalactite.

<pre>(spike
  (direction 2)           ;; 0: north, 1: south, 2: west, 3: east
)</pre>

==== Yeti ====
<pre>(yeti
  (dead-script "
// A squirrel script that is executed once the Yeti dies.
")
)</pre>
