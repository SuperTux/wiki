This is a list of potential bugs in SuperTux that I have noticed but have not taken the time to properly report.  I'm publishing it here for the sake of open development.

See also the patches at https://mattmccutchen.net/private/supertux.git/ .

* 2009-12-28: Coins in 1-tile gaps are collected inconsistently in Boney.M Mega Mix.  Maybe another issue with floating point error vs. x coordinate?

* 2010-01-02: After setting magnification to 125% and entering and aborting a level,  options menu incorrectly shows magnification as auto.
** OptionsMenu constructor is not selecting existing values.  (Resolution too?)

* 2010-01-11: Key levels should do statistics just like other levels, and maybe invincibility too to be safe.

* 2010-01-11: Integer screen coordinates

* 2010-01-11: What is the aspect ratio control supposed to do?  Values other than "auto" produce a display ridiculously stretched horizontally.  I guess we want 2880:900.  But why, when the window is smaller???

* 2010-01-21: Everything in the collision detection torture test

* 2010-01-21: Shrink tilemaps to size

* 2010-01-22: Editor: Bad handling of dithered editor-images when zoomed out.  Need to average.

* 2010-01-22: Memory leaks...

* 2010-01-23: Position of "Best Level Statistics" in worldmap does not update correctly on window resize.

* 2010-01-24: Not sure I like the new behavior where ice blocks and snails die immediately when stomped with invincibility.

* 2010-01-24: "Short Visit to El Castillo": Upper dart trap is not operating.  Intentional?

* 2010-01-24: Editor: Clicking eye field of unfocused layer in the list cycles the visibility right away for a visible tilemap, not otherwise.  Inconsistent.

* 2010-01-27: Badguys getting stuck on slopes against walls in the second sector of "A Village in the Forest".

* 2010-01-28: Big/small Tux seems to affect position of worldmap character but not size.  That's weird.

* 2010-01-28: jump_early_apex happening during buttjumps.

* 2010-01-28: In "Find the Bigger Fish", under the pipe in the lower sector, why does the wind appear to make my low jumps /lower/?

* 2010-01-31: Editor: Typing ".3" in path node time, 0 is inserted automatically.  Distracting and mispositions cursor.  Validate on blur?

* 2010-01-31: Editor: Crash when right-clicking a tilemap in the list after resizing it.  Partially known issue?

* 2010-01-31: Cannot have objects controlled by fix_old_tiles on a moving tilemap.

* 2010-02-09: In the beginning of one of the "moo" levels, a snowball's sprite is not set correctly when it is dying.

* 2010-02-09: In some forest levels, a zeekling killed exactly at ground level will sit in place for a few seconds with the original sprite.  Seen twice, may be hard to reproduce.

* 2010-02-09: "Village in the Forest": When pulling the switch, the sleeping spiky disappears as the camera pans.  Maybe a deactivation issue.

* 2010-02-09: "Kneep-deep in the Depth" should not have an end sequence trigger, for consistency with the other key levels.

* 2010-02-09: "Treasure in the skies": Climbable area extends into thin air.

* 2010-02-15: Possible to lose while winning:
** (2010-02-15 05:10:59 UTC) Forty-Two: I notice that in Light and Magic, if you reach the finish while holding a lantern, you drop it and it kills you (you lose 25 coins) although you also finish the level
** Can fall off the screen (only in pathological levels)

* 2010-02-20: Can jump over some of the exits:
** Up and Down
** Tux the Builder
* Others?

* 2010-02-24: If I hold a camera pan key (e.g., delete) when leaving a sector, the camera pan persists when re-entering the sector even if I am not holding the key.

* 2010-03-01: In octo's "Broken Elevator", lava is killing me even when it is invisible.  Bug in the effective solidity report ({{bug|524}})?

* 2010-03-01: Hilarious glitch seen in octo's "Yoshi's Island 2".  When we change sectors while holding an ice block, the player in the first sector is still holding the ice block.  If we now return to the first sector in a different place, the ice block flies into Tux's arms.  Tracking bug for "too much sector-specific state"?

* 2010-03-01: Need to clear backflipping when starting to climb.
