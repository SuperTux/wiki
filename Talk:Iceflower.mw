I think ice bullets should freeze ice badguys as well, adding size and 2-6 hp and either slowing them down or stopping them completely. Also i think ice bullets are too powerful, they are almost more desireable in every way to fire bullets. They do not bounce, so they hit *every* badguy in their path, they also can cross vast expanses. They do not cause forest fires. Fire bullet gets bad effects from mudball, possibly tumbleweed, and probably walkingtotems and any tree badguys. -F50
:Is not that ice bullets are too good, I think that the fire bullets are too weak by themselves, even in Super Mario most of the other powerups (besides mushrooms) beat them. --[[User:80.174.65.16|80.174.65.16]] 21:32, 11 Aug 2006 (BST)
But with ice bullets, you can't arc down and hit enemies below. --[[User:TON|TON]] 20:25, 25 November 2007 (UTC)

==Platforms==
I think it could be cool if the frost enemies could serve as platforms, so they dont get destroyed if you jump above them and be useful to get to higher places. If you want to make them destroyable they could be by butt jumping, for example. --[[User:80.174.65.16|80.174.65.16]] 21:30, 11 Aug 2006 (BST)

==ButtJump==
Iced enemies might be killed in one hit with a ButtJump (even normally non-squishable ones, like Spiky or Jumpy). Otherwise, I think IceTux would be less useful than FireTux (able to kill nearly everything). -Shylence

It looks cool, but I don't really think he got the idea when the article said it needed graphics. We need graphics, but we already have a picture of the iceflower. We need more pictures of frozen badguys.
