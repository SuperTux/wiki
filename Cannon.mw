A '''Cannon''' is a [[game object]] that spawns new [[badguy]]s. The interval in which badguys are spawned is either fixed or random. A cannon can be shot with either the [[fireflower]] (dies) or [[iceflower]] (stops it emitting new badguys). Whether or not the dispenser is squishable and butt-jumpable depends on the appearance: The ''trapdoor'' and ''rocket launcher'' types are immune to [[Tux]] standing or jumping on them, the ''cannon'' type can be broken this way.

== Appearance ==

There are three possible sprites for this object: Trapdoor, cannon and (in lack of a better word) rocket launcher. Please note that despite the name, ''rocket launcher'' is the preferred appearance, at least in [[Icy Island]] ([[Milestone 2]]).
