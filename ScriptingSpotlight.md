Summary
-------

A `Spotlight` that was given a name can be controlled by scripts.

Method | Explanation
-------|-------
`void set_enabled(bool enabled)` | Enables/disables the spotlight. 
`bool is_enabled()` | Returns `true` if the spotlight is enabled. 
`void set_direction(string direction)` | Sets the direction of the spotlight. 
`void set_angle(float angle)` | Sets the angle of the spotlight. 
`void fade_angle(float angle, float time)` | Fades the angle of the spotlight in `time` seconds. 
`void ease_angle(float angle, float time, string easing)` | Fades the angle of the spotlight in `time` seconds, with easing. 
`void set_speed(float speed)` | Sets the speed of the spotlight. 
`void fade_speed(float speed, float time)` | Fades the speed of the spotlight in `time` seconds. 
`void ease_speed(float speed, float time, string easing)` | Fades the speed of the spotlight in `time` seconds, with easing. 
`void set_color_rgba(float r, float g, float b, float a)` | Sets the RGBA color of the spotlight. 
`void fade_color_rgba(float r, float g, float b, float a, float time)` | Fades the spotlight to a new RGBA color in `time` seconds. 
`void ease_color_rgba(float r, float g, float b, float a, float time, string easing)` | Fades the spotlight to a new RGBA color in `time` seconds, with easing.
