*" Somewhere at the shores of Antarctica... "*

Introduction
------------

The story of SuperTux focuses on Tux the penguin who has to save his beloved girlfriend Penny
from the clutches of the evil Nolok.

It all started with a nice picnic between the two on the ice fields of Icy Island. Suddenly,
Nolok jumped from behind a nearby ice bush and summoned a bright flash with his mighty staff.
The flash blinded Tux and Penny was captured in the process, leaving only a small note behind.

*"Tux, I have kidnapped your beloved Penny and have taken her to my fortress. The path to my
fortress is littered with my minions. You don't have a chance of saving her!"* - Signed, Nolok.

Realizing the trouble Penny could be in, Tux became determined to save her. Thus beginning his
quest throughout Icy Island.

Icy Island
----------

During his journey, Tux must traverse through a frozen cavern in order to reach the other side of
the island. Upon reaching the exit of the cave, Tux noticed a strange sound in the distance. A
yeti appeared to be watching him from afar. Before Tux could do anything, however, the yeti ran away.
Tux was concerned by the yeti's sudden retreat but decided to continue his journey as he had spotted
a castle.

Tux finally reached the castle but was shocked upon seeing an empty throne room. No Nolok, no Penny.
Only a note written by Penny. Nolok had tricked him and took off with Penny to a far forest. Tux began
to worry even more now. He had no idea where the forest was or how to get there. His worries were cut
short however, as out of a sudden the yeti had returned running right towards him shouting aggressively!
Tux immediately ran towards a nearby door leading to a balcony and jumped. The yeti followed him outside
hunting him down to a small incline, leaving Tux no other choice than to fight the yeti.

At last, the yeti was beaten. Rubbing his head and angrily grunting the yeti communicated his disbelief.
When asked by Tux if he knew where Nolok went and how he could get there the yeti just laughed at the penguin.
Though, while further tantalizing Tux about his cluelessness the yeti accidentally revealed the location of the
forest and where to find a boat. Realizing this, the yeti sets off before revealing even more infomation leaving
Tux behind. Tux now knew where he must go and sets off towards the glacier islands to find the crystal mine.

Rooted Forest
-------------

A long trip to the north with a boat and Tux finally managed to reach the southern lands of Rooted Forest.
Astonished by the scale of the forest and the much warmer temperatures Tux continued his search for Nolok and
Penny. Since he had no idea where Nolok could have stationed his forest castle he went ahead and climbed onto
a high plateau through a mossy and rocky cavern to get a better view. 

After a long journey through the woods, rough weather and a dark underground section, something very strange
started happening. The trees and bushes, the entire forest that Tux was in began changing. Everything began to
rot away, turning bluish purple, covered in thick dark green vines. Eerie wisps and living flames emerged.
Nolok's minions he encountered before were affected as well looking much more menacing and eerie, but also...
worried. Some were even covered in purple roots. Tux felt uneasy but pushed forward.

Soon later, Tux discovered a tower close by. He entered the tower, but yet again no Nolok nor Penny in sight.
Now Tux was completely at a loss. Suddenly, the walls and roof began crumbling, gigantic purple roots emerged
from all places and flailing around aggressively tearing the tower appart. Tux ran out of the tower as fast as
he could, only to find the root of these troubles. An enormous, terrifying tree with deep dark holes as eyes,
gazed down upon the small penguin and began attacking with all its might.

After a rough battle, Tux managed to destroy the Ghost Tree healing the forest and all beings affected by it.
But his journey wasn't over just yet...

Proposed story for preexisting/future worlds
--------------------------------------------

This section is just some brainstorming ideas for future worlds that may or may not exist.

### Ghost/Corrupt Forest

The Ghost Tree was planted by Nolok using his mighty staff to corrupt the forest and its inhabitants to be
more eerie and dangerous. A group of Granito, inhabitants of the forest who have not yet been overtaken
by the Ghost Tree's disease asked Tux to help save their home and fellow Granito that have been corrupted already.
When the Ghost Tree is destroyed and the Granito are healed some of the once infected Granito living near the tower
inform Tux about noticing someone strange leaving with another of Tux's kind to the north-east, shortly before the
disease began to spread.

### Tropical Paradise

On the tropical islands of Tropical Paradise resites a majestic Toucan among the totem temples creating totems
in his image. Nolok meets the bird and offered him more land and power if he could successfully impede Tux's
progress and defend the hidden teleporter to his fortress on top of a mountain peak.

### Nolok's Mountain Peak

Tux had now finally found Nolok's final fortress on top an enormous mountain. However, the entrance door was locked
requiring five keys for it to be opened. Nolok, from across his walls, taunts Tux telling him that he hid away the
keys all over the world and without these Penny would be lost forever.

### Penny's Story Add-on

While captured, Penny attempts to flee herself but in the end is stopped by the cunning Nolok. But instead of giving up
she writes down information she overhears from Nolok himself in a letter in hopes to reach Tux and to inform him on
Nolok's plans help him as much as she can on his journey.

### Nolok's Motive

Nolok as a character derives pleasure from causing harm or crime. So the reason he kidnaps Penny is that he derives
entertainment out of Tux feeling sorrow towards his beloved Penny and having no idea where to find here. Additionally,
enjoys to see Tux suffer on his journey thus setting out his minions, leading him to a false castle or corrupting an
entire forest to frighten him.

Once Tux reaches the end of Rooted Forest, Nolok starts to notice Tux's determination being impressed by his commitment
and bravery to push through even leaving his homeland. After defeating Nolok and rescuing Penny, Nolok acknowledges Tux
and Penny's bravery shown a more honorable side. He claims to not change his ways due to his nature as a predator, but
that he respects the two as his equals.

*(Note: Should Nolok ever capture her again or perhaps Tux, he would do it for the entertainment of them having to go
through his challenges again.)*
