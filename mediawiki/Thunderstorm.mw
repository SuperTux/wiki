{{Milestone 2}}
When the Thunderstorm goes off, you will hear distant thunder. Shortly afterwards a lightning strikes, making the screen flash. All water in the level is electrified when the lightning hits and reverts to normal afterwards.

The Thunderstorm can be configured to go off at regular intervals or alternatively be scripted. See [[ScriptingThunderstorm]] for a quick reference.
