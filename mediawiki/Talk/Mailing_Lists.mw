It's right there in the article... --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 20:44, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

== Mailing List  Archive Down? ==

The archive link http://lists.lethargik.org/pipermail/supertux-devel-lethargik.org/ gives me a 404 for some time now. Is there a new URL or is the server broken? --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 17:49, 6 September 2007 (UTC)
