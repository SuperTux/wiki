The throwable snowball idea definitely sounds like a winner to me, much better than the current iceflower.  NathanKP

As far as liquids go acid doesn't make any sense in World 1, although water and/or slushy snow is realistic.  Acid would be better reserved for a different world.  Also, what about lava?

Sliding Tux sound like a really cool idea, but implementation will be very complicated!  Will it use prerendered rotated images for Tux or will OpenGL rotate the Tux-on-belly image in realtime?  NathanKP
