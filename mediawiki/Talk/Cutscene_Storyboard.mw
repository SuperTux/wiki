== Antarctica Ending ==
I think the end for antarctica should show the yeti pulling out a big club and whacking him to the next world -F50
:That doesn't make a lot of sense after Tux was victorous over him...
:: Tux doesn't have to defeat the yeti, just hurt him a couple of times. See [[Talk:Yeti]] for the original propostion of the idea -F50
::: I still think this is stupid. Tux should defeat the Yeti and move on (although I'm still not sure how exactly). And why should we make a reference to a dumb flash game? -Wansti

== Play as Penny ==
Perhaps the player can choose between using Tux or Penny for milestone 3. Also why does Penny go to this world instead of anywhere else and does Tux follow somehow?
: That is to be explained after milestone 2; according to these story ideas, the forest world gets an open end with Tux beating the boss and Penny escaping, both unaware of each other's presence. -Wansti

== Butt Jump ==
I like the idea of the yeti teaching Tux the butt-jump. For flapping Tux could fall off a cliff on his way to the forest and learn by necessity. -F50

== World 3 ==
Did we already make a decision saying that world 3 will be a tropical island? -Wansti

Yes (altough not very conclusive), it was kind of decided in that IRC meeting - tuxthepenguin

== Island Puzzle ==
An idea for the island puzzle: A (mathematical?)(randomly generated?) hint is given to the location of an item, tunnel, or path, leading to the a goal. Then Tux/Penny would have to play levels in an area of the ocean or a lake to find it.  I think these levels be different from other levels in that Tux/Penny could pass them without playing them. Also, read [[Rejected ideas]] to see why the KDE dragon and the GNOME gnome will not be introduced.  -F50
