What about having the top and bottom segments variable vertically and the middle segment not... or why not have all three segments variable vertically? -F50

: If more than one segment is variable vertically, how would you determine where one segment ends and the other one starts? You'd have to define a point where that happens, and then you could just as well give one of them a fixed size. -Wansti

: Of course you could define that point new for every level... I'll keep it in mind. -Wansti

:: The use of actual background images should be as minimal as possible, instead the background should simply be formed out of multiple tilemaps, maybe with a simple background image at the very last layer (a sky color gradient with some clouds or the like).
