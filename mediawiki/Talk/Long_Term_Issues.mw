== What Tux should look like with Fire Flower ==

'''What's in MS1:''' Tux is tinted red.

'''What's in SVN:''' Tux is wearing a fireman's hat.
: Of the presented alternatives I prefer firehat. The MS1 one is uggly, and I have not seen that one with a headband, any link to that image? --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 23:17, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

'''Grumbel's concept art:''' Tux wears a dragon suit.

'''Fan concept:''' Tux wears a headband.

: I don't care much what we end up with, as long as it is not a fireman's hat or anything else that relates to the real world. We might also drop fireflower completly or change its behaviour a lot, no need to staying to close to Mario on that one. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 03:33, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

: Of the options presented here, I like the fireman's hat the best.  It would be cool to have different objects trigger different types of throwables, similar to the early MegaMan games. Some ideas: a limited number of "swarm" throwables that would scatter and kill anything in their path. A bomb that goes for a certain distance then explodes. Have the snowball freeze, but not kill, a bad guy. A "guided fish missile" that would home in on an enemy no matter where they are --[[User:Mbsmith|Mbsmith]] 11:11, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

== Life and Death ==

'''What's in MS1:''' Tux starts with 4 lives.  Gains a life via collecting 100 coins or one-up item.  99 lives max.

'''What's in SVN:''' Tux starts with 100 coins.  One-up item adds 100 coins.  Tux loses 25 coins or the current number of coins divided by 10, whichever is greater when a checkpoint is used.
: Of the presented alternatives I prefer this but it isn't very good either, maybe a mix of this and tuxdev's concept? --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 23:17, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

'''Grumbel's concept:''' Death should be eliminated, coinage should be only a per-level statistic.

'''tuxdev's concept:''' Make life-and-death equavalent to how they were in MS1 except with coins. Then make some special abilities use up coins (like butt-jump).

== Run or Walk? ==

'''What's in MS1:''' Tux runs when pressing the Action key, walks otherwise
: Of the presented alternatives I strongly prefer this. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 23:17, 13 June 2007 (UTC)
:: <small>Adding a note to explain why:</small> This is best for new users because that is the common way in other games as far as I know. I can get used to either. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 23:27, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

: I totally agree with this. Coming from other games and MS1, I think it makes sense to have Tux run when the Action key is pressed. I might be missing something, but I have not found a level where I need to slow down in order to get past an obstacle. Automatically running after a certain number of steps / time works as well, but it adds a bit of an extra challenge to push the key to run --[[User:Mbsmith|Mbsmith]] 11:11, 14 June 2007 (UTC) 

'''What's in SVN:''' Tux runs by default, walks when pressing the Action key.

: Run should be automatic, with proper acceleration. If all fails we can fall back to the run key, but we should never have a walk-key. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]] 03:29, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

== Up and Jump (resolved) ==
'''What's in MS1:''' Jump is the up arrow key by default, there is no use of an Up key.
: Of the presented alternatives I prefer this. But up key is useful to, we need it, but I can't stand jump on space. My keyboard can't handle that while also running. Space + arrow + ctrl = too much. So for me this is the only way. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 23:17, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

'''What's in SVN:''' Jump is the space key by default, Up is mapped to the up arrow key.

'''The problem:''' Some fans have gotten used to the MS1 setup, so they make Jump the up arrow key and Up the space key.  This causes problems in the worldmap. They use the up arrow key to go up, and instead they enter a level because the Jump key means enter level on the worldmap.

'''The question:''' Should we hack SuperTux so that the up arrow key can mean jump in a level and up in a worldmap?
: In my opinion: YES. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 23:17, 13 June 2007 (UTC)

: Yes, no point in arguing, this has to be fixed. Only thing to keep in mind is that we might get trouble with using Up-key for entering doors. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]]

: Clearly. This has been a major pet peeve for a while. By the way, how has this been "resolved"? Is there a fix in the nightly? --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]]: N0 PH33R 11:19, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

:: The discussion on what should be done is resolved, not the implementation. -- [[User:Grumbel|Grumbel]]
