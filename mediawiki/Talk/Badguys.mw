== Fish ==
Did we actually use any fishes in [[Icyisland]]? - sik0fewl

Not that I've seen, maybe should add some? Seems to me World1 should still be improved (i.e. add more paths) - zratchet

No, I think we should leave World1 as-is, except for a boss and maybe minibosses. - sik0fewl

I removed [[Fish]] from [[Icyisland]] list - sik0fewl

Which world and milestone is [[skullyhop]] technically in? --[[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 01:39, 28 June 2012 (UTC)

== Cactus ==
I don't think a cactus really fits in with the forest theme, it's more of a desert thing. - sik0fewl

both dillos and cacti are in the jungle. I've read about it. - zratchet

== Difficulty ==
Personally I think that World1 is far too long and too hard, especially if we want to add more levels. Also, it's too SMB1-ish (monotonous). - NabsS

: Please be more constructive in your criticism. If you found it monotonous, supply ideas on how to make it more interesting. It's better to have a goal to work towards instead of only having something to avoid...

: Maybe Icyisland could have slopes and more-than-one-screen-high levels? Icy levels should benefit of work done after they were made, not being stuck to what they were. --[[User:PolyPrograms|polyprograms]] 14:07, 7 Sep 2006 (BST)

==Standardization?==
Looking around, I noticed that badguys' data is a bit messy. What about a template like this?

'''Badguy name'''

'''Game sprite:''' picture of the badguy

'''Found in:''' Icyisland, Light Forest and so on

'''Behaviour:''' basic behaviour, like "Walks around", "Jumps" and so on

'''Squishable:''' yes or no, plus effects triggered by squishing (like Mr.Tree's and Mr. Iceblock's)

'''"Butt-Jumpable":''' effect when Butt-Jumped (maybe with another label...)

'''Freezable: '''effect on contact with IceBullet (e.g. for Mr Bomb this would be something like "Yes. Can be carried when frozen")

'''Burnable: '''effect on contact with FireBullet, Lava and so on

Voices like ''Implemented since MS 1/2'' and ''Current status: implemented/to be implemented/proposed/rejected'' might also be useful.

: Having such a template would really be great. Maybe it could even be a Wiki Template. Now all that left to do is finding someone willing to apply the template ;-)

It works now, see [[Template:Badguy]]. Use it as <nowiki>[[Template:</nowiki>badguy|''badguy name''|''image name''|''found in''|''behaviour''|''squishable''|''buttjumpable''|''freezable''|''burnable''<nowiki>]]</nowiki>. Italic parts are variable. -Shylence

New Format is <nowiki>[[Template:Badguy | name=Spiky | image=Spiky | worlds=IcyIsland | appearance=Mr. Snowball wearing a spiky helmet | behaviour=Walks around | squish=no | butt-jump=no | freeze=yes | ignite=yes, killed ]]</nowiki>

== The [[Template:Infobox Badguy|Infobox Badguy]] template ==

I've spent some hours today getting the [[badguy]]s organized and standardized. I have created the [[Template:Infobox Badguy|Infobox Badguy]] template which displays a nice infobox on the right of each badguy's page and uses some wiki magic to put each badguy into a number of categories. This template obsoletes the old and, I'm sorry to say, rather ugly [[Template:Badguy|Badguy]] template.

Further ideas are:
* Add a ''Version'' argument which automatically translates to “Status: Released” and “Status: Development” and puts the badguy into a category for that version.
* For each badguy, create list in which levels he/she/it appears. This should be pretty easy to extract from the .stl-files with a small script.

Any feedback is highly welcome. —[[User:Octo|octo]] 19:03, 24 January 2010 (UTC)
