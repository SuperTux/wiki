== Shouldn't Have to be Beaten First ==
game shouldn't have to be beaten first to do the race mode. We shouldn't have a new menu, we should just keep track of time in the background all the time. - sik0fewl

:I think it would be better that when a player is on the world map, he/she can select either race mode or single player mode. It just seems to bloated to have a whole new menu for it like sik0fewl said. - Drahcir
