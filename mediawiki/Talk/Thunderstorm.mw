In the real world the lightning occurs before the thunder. Why do the game do it the other way around? Is there a good reason? --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 22:16, 17 Jul 2006 (BST)
: The game doesn't. It's "thunder", then "thunder and lightning". A time difference would only make sense if the thunderstorm was far away. However, it needs to be simultaneous to give the impression that the thunderstorm is right above you and lend credibility to the fact that all water gets electrified. --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 23:06, 17 Jul 2006 (BST)
::In that case why not only "thunder and lightning" instead of "thunder, then thunder and lightning"? --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 23:13, 17 Jul 2006 (BST)
:::As a warning before tux gets electrocuted.
