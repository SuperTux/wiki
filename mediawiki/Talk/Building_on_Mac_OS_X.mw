If you have any bugs with building or with a ready-made developement binary, please post it/them here.  If you know that it is a bug related to SuperTux and not to the binary, please post it on the [http://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/ SuperTux Bug Tracker], otherwise, if the bug is a bug with the binary or you are unsure, please post here rather than on the SuperTux Bug Tracker.

Thank you, [[User:GlowingApple|GlowingApple]]
