== Simplicity ==
Simplicity should be kept in the game. Too many actions are often not a great thing.
How are the achievements of Blowflying, flapping (double jumping) and roping very different?
They all allow you to jump further - which running already does.

Maybe running could be taken out and replaced when something like Blowflying or flapping is introduced.

Possibly you could have flapping (double jumping) included as a normal action instead of running&jumping (which is less fun) and then the Blowflyer can be a powerup, similar to how you can get a fireflower - this powerup lets you blowfly and hence go much higher than previously through jumping (see kirby in super smash brothers). Roping and running, I would think, aren't really needed.

Just my thoughts..

On second thoughts, running could be changed to metroid fusion style running - where you start running automatically if you take a run-up. This would create depth to the game without complexity of controls etc.

flapping gives you extra 'airtime', ie. you can far better fine-tune your jumping, since you can actually fly for a second or two with flapping enabled, play YoshisIsland to see what it is good for and why it is extremly important. Blowflyer on the other side shouldn't be a normal action, but more something to which you can transform Tux at special location, say when a helium bottle is there, it acts only for a limited amount of time and lets you reach places that you couldn't with your normal actions. Roping should also not be a normal action, but simply something that Tux might be able to do when a Rope is hanging around, actually roping would be pretty similar to sliding and might thus be not needed. - grumbel
