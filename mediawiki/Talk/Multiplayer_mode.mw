== Focus on Singleplayer ==
I really think that we should first design a solid singleplayer game before even thinking about this. The games primary focus should be the singleplayer. - Matze

:If there is a 2nd Player mode, who would the 2nd character be? Maybe Tux's Albino cousin :-).

::Or perhaps we can wait until Penny shows up (in Milestone III) and let the second player be HER? (I think two Tuxes would be interesting, but kinda junky). --[[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 04:56, 2 July 2009 (UTC)- JuliusFreezer

:I agree with Matze. The game should be close to complete before we start on this. It could be a lot of work and slow the development speed down. - Drahcir

:Ups... '''better''' to plan multiplayer together with singleplayer. It's not a lot of problem. But, if do not think about it now and start to '''implement soon''', it can be a problem. ;)

:: Agreed. Plan it and implement it, but it can take a low priority in development. It could just be a thing in the background that you can't use, and then a patch comes out for it or something...just a thought. --[[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 04:56, 2 July 2009 (UTC)
