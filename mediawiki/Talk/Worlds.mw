== Originality ==
Most of these proposed worlds have already been done in at least one Super Mario game. Let's try to come up with something that hasn't been done this many times before.
I'd like an industrial/tech themed world, though.

Ever since Milestone 1 came out I've been thinking about Tux in a metropolis, with factories and stores. That gives a broad range of levels, from crossing the street on top of cars to releasing fellow penguins from a zoo to a level like the "droid" factory in Star Wars II. The possibilities are endless.

IIRC, I saw a tech themed world on one of the Marios for the Gameboy.  A tech themed world would be great as sort of a Star World graphics trigger for those of us that misses the BSODs of classic SuperTux.  I don't think we will be able to really think up of anything that hasn't been done by Mario and still fits with the natural setting of SuperTux, simply because the SMB guys have had 20 years and who-knows-how-many games to come up with original worlds.  Doesn't mean we can't try. ;-)

Industrial world was used in Lode Runner: The Legend Returns and Lode Runner: The Mad Monks' Revenge... Hey, I'll mention the other worlds in these games: grassland world, fungus world, Dark world, Lava world (my personal favorite), Phosphorus world, ice world, ancient world (an ancient city), fossil world (basically a desert), and crystal world. Also, Mad Monks' Revenge has a water world and an outer space world.

As we have 10 proposed worlds, maybe we should consider the "main game" over after world 8 and have the others be "extra worlds" that you will be in if you reload your save. --[[Special:Contributions/71.220.24.97|71.220.24.97]] 13:41, 10 January 2009 (UTC)
