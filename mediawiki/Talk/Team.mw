== Names ==
Are the people on this the whole team? Looking at the mailing list, there are just too many anonymous people. Is this page a way to distinguish the clowns from real developers? How can you tell if "L", "Jabba TheHutt", "Mathnerd314" or "GG" is to be taken serious if they don't even dare to sign with a real name? On the other hand I don't want to piss of any developer, so sorry if one of the guys I used as example really is important. Nice to have some connection between IRC, the mailing list, bugtracker, SVN, forum and the wiki for developers as well as for fans.

:True; this is currently incomplete. I believe it's missing two people: Me (Mathnerd314) and mmlosh. (but he only works on the editor) I will add myself and him soon.
:As for why I don't like giving my real name, it's mostly to maintain a low profile on Google. There are currently no relevant results, and I want to keep it that way. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 14:57, 11 August 2008 (UTC)

== Active admins? ==
I thing, all admins aren't active. (expect MMlosh)
