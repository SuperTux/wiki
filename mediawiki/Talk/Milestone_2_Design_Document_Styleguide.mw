:* Don't create jumps that require pixel perfect precision unless it is for a special secret area.

* One thing in particular that I hate is jumps where bigtux usually bumps his head if you don't make a pixel perfect jump. This happens when there are only zero or one spaces above Tux to jump. In example <tt>a)</tt> below, smalltux (<tt>*</tt>) can jump from tile <tt>X</tt> to tile <tt>Y</tt> without much difficulty. In example <tt>b)</tt> it's almost impossible for bigtux to jump from tile <tt>X</tt> to tile <tt>Y</tt> because he hits his head on <tt>Z</tt> right away.

* Do not create exclusive collectable power-ups: I can collect booth power-ups, but if you collect the first, I can not collect the secound.
* Do not create exclusive reachable secret areas: I can reach booth secret areas, but if you reach the first, I can not reach the secound.
* Do not close the jumpy to too low passageways. So it's hard to get over it.[[Image:Not-jumpy.png|200px|thumb|left|How to not using jumpy]]

== Third World Problem ==

What exactly is this "Fun Pif" mentioned in the Design Document as part of world three? While I know what "Fun" is I never heard of a "Pif".
