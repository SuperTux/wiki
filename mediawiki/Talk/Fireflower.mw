== Fire bullet action ==

I think that the fire bullet should behave similarly to the way it behaves in M1, but maybe set some badguys alight. Also, I think that each time a bullet is fired, it should generate an ambient light around it, so you can light up darkness with it.
: I agree. I was disappointed when I couldn't light the dark at the end of "Light and Magic" with my fireballs...plus flaming trees would be interesting. --[[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 04:26, 25 June 2009 (UTC)
: (note: I ''do'' prefer the M2 fireballs over the M1 ones, though)
