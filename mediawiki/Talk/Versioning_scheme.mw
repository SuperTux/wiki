Why not make 0.1.x versions 0.2.x versions? It would fit with the new versioing scheme that way, since it would be an even-numbered stable release. --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 21:51, 25 Sep 2006 (BST)

== 1.0 ==

Why not make milestone 2 1.0? The SVN build i've played really looks complete enough to me. Besides: a 0.x looks to most people like a crappy beta version, which milestone 2 obviously is not. [[User:Cristan|Cristan]] 14:01, 13 Nov 2006 (CET)
