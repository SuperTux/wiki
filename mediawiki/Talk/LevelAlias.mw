== Purpose ==
What exactly is this page for? [[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 01:22, 21 October 2007 (UTC)
:Simple, a way to find English name of a level for people to report a bug that developers can understand. If someone reports a bug in the level <name in some other language> most developers will be unable to understand what level that is. This page would need more work though. --[[User:AnMaster|AnMaster]] 11:18, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

== Missing Characters ==
What's the encoding of this wiki? Isn't it UTF-8? Why there are so many characters displayed as <?> here? --[[User:Lsz|Lsz]] 01:08, 2 July 2008 (UTC)
:Probably because you don't have the required glyphs in your font. --[[User:62.214.243.103|62.214.243.103]] 17:35, 2 July 2008 (UTC)
::I don't think so, since I have installed DejaVu Sans which covers Basic Latin, Latin-1, Latin-extended-A,B,C and D. I still think it is the encoding problem. --[[User:Lsz|Lsz]] 23:21, 2 July 2008 (UTC)
:::Yes, when I updated the page I converted the text several times between ~4 charsets. You can fix the annoying ones if you want. I'm just glad that the translations are there at all. :) --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 00:17, 3 July 2008 (UTC)
::::I think you should at least tell people to use which encoding: I tried UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-15, IBM-850, Windows-1252 and all failed. (for example the German(de) ones) Now I am completely confused. --[[User:Lsz|Lsz]] 06:40, 4 July 2008 (UTC)
:::::I believe the problem is that the characters on the wiki are invalid in all charsets; the information was lost in the conversions I did. The encoding of the wiki is Unicode UTF-8, which doesn't really help. The original translations, which do have the correct charset, are .po files in the subdirectories of http://supertux.lethargik.org/svn/supertux/trunk/supertux/data/levels/; various charsets are used, but they are documented in the line reading "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=...". I used a combination of grep, notepad, OpenOffice, and the system clipboard to generate this page from the various .po files; I'm pretty certain one or more of those tools is unaware of charsets and misread the characters. My development machine is unavailable at the moment; in about a month, I can produce the exact steps for you. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 20:42, 5 July 2008 (UTC)
::::::Yeah, grep is a great tool. What's this page for if we have grep?
:::::::It's for those who don't have grep, or don't want to spend the extra time running it. (A pre-processed grep) --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 16:38, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

== Convert to UTF-8 ==
And, why don't you just convert all the files in supertux to UTF-8 to avoid a lot of annoying problems?
:Ask the translators that, or better yet, why don't you convert all the files to utf-8? I have no idea how to, but you clearly do. It seems like all the translations are either in UTF-8 or in ISO-8859-1, so you already have half your work done. Send an archive once you're done... --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 16:38, 6 July 2008 (UTC)
:: Done. posted here: [http://www.2shared.com/file/3556293/ec095a38/potar.html]. Would you like to let me upload files of any format on the wiki, since uploading to other sites is not good... --[[User:Lsz|Lsz]] 02:53, 7 July 2008 (UTC)
:: and, there was an ISO-8859-15 and an ISO-8859-2 file... --[[User:Lsz|Lsz]] 02:53, 7 July 2008 (UTC)
