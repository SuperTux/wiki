This is way too much talk. Just let the actions speak for themself and let tux murp a bit around. Real text will just make trouble when translating and it's a bit odd too when penguins talk.

I think it's cute. Just a bit too verbose. Like the seal said, Tux needs to stop talking to himself. I'd say the speech we have is good enough so far.<br>--[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]] 21:21, 16 Sep 2006 (BST)
