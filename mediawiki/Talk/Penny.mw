== Accessories ==

I just wanted to ask why not giving penny some accessoires which are making her more feminine? sorry, but i don t like her look! 
perhaps it could be possible to give some accessoires to tux as well, at all he looks IMHO a little bit to clean!Accessories

:*I'm thinking maybe Penny gets the ice-hat, opposed to Tux's fire-hat? I've tried it... [[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 22:52, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

== Three-dimensional Penny ==

Does anybody have any sort of 3-D file for Penny? The pics are nice, but I'd be interested in the 3-D version. [[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 17:18, 18 May 2009 (UTC)
