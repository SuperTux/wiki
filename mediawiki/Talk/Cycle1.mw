Change worldmap to have alternative ways and shortcuts. It should be possible to beat worldmap 1 with 7 levels (So users don't have to play all 26 levels again to get to world2). All the other levels should stay but be on alternative/optional paths

: This is a good idea but some of the levels just lead to dead ends and this seems kind of silly. Shouldn't we think of something better to do with them? - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 05:30, 6 Apr 2006 (BST)
