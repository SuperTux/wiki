== gcc-g++ package needed ==

I had to install one additional package in order to get SuperTux to compile -- the MinGW gcc-g++ package for compiling C++ code, found [http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/gcc-g++-3.4.2-20040916-1.tar.gz?download here]. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]]

== libcurl missing? ==

When I want to compile SuperTux on windows xp, i get an error because the sourcefile addon_manager.cpp needs LIBCURL... but i don't know where i can find the right LIBCURL-package for windows and how to install it (with MSYS ...) please update this page.. - [[User:TowelieDasTuch|TowelieDasTuch]]

Note that we don't have a windows maintainer and most developers have better things to do than rebooting to windows. Motivation is a bit low to keep stuff compiling on windows just for the sake of other people playing svn versions... Basically: Please try a little harder fixing it yourself! --[[User:MatzeB|MatzeB]] 20:34, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

: By the way - libcurl shouldn't be needed to compile SuperTux. You can safely remove the check for libcurl from the autoconf scripts (just go back a few SVN revisions) and SuperTux should build just fine. Send us a patch if you can change the autoconf scripts to make it truly optional. --[[User:Sommer|Sommer]] 21:37, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

== DLLs needed ==

SuperTux seems to run fine with only the following DLLs in place
* libogg-0.dll
* libphysfs-1-0-0.dll
* SDL.dll
* SDL_image.dll
Further investigation necessary

== Install SDL ==

Hi, I have no idea how to install SDL .. I don't know what to do after unpacking the SDL-package ... please help me =)

== Wine ==

Just for fun I ran Supertux 0.3.1 in Wine. The installer worked all right, supertux2.exe runs but it is too slow to be fun. It is faster than SDL-Mode but still too slow. On my machine Supertux works fine when playing the native version. No idea what went wrong here, other games run in Wine just a bit slower or even as fast as in Windows but not Supertux. Not a real problem from me but maybe the windows port has some problems?

== Please improve documentation. ==

Please help improving the experience for users of M$ Windows. Bugs reports like https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=817 or https://supertux.lethargik.org/bugs/view.php?id=818 show that there is a lack of information. If you know how to build Supertux on Windows it would be nice if you could add the missing details to allow other players to build their own version of this great game. TIA --[[Special:Contributions/88.130.20.168|88.130.20.168]] 10:11, 9 July 2011 (UTC)
:While I commend you on a better (read more thought-out) comment, I disagree with the need for better documentation. Those two reports show that the individual simply didn't read the documentation period. The first one isn't even a real question and the second is answered on [http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Building_on_Windows#FastBuild_with_Visual_Studio Building on Windows/FastBuild with Visual Studio] that he/she supposedly read but obviously didn't finish reading. -- Qwood [[Special:Contributions/Qwood|(contribs)]] [[User talk:Qwood|(talk)]] 12:24, 9 July 2011 (UTC)
:As an additional note, if the individual doesn't know how to set environment variables that should have been the question. Even if that is the case, Google is your friend. -- Qwood [[Special:Contributions/Qwood|(contribs)]] [[User talk:Qwood|(talk)]] 12:28, 9 July 2011 (UTC)
