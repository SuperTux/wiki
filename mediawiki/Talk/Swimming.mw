''What happens to existing levels, especially in situations where the water is on the bottom of a shaft with no way to climb out?'' - how about Tux having a limited air supply?
:Guybrush Threepwood can hold his breath for ten minutes. A penguin should do even better. And that is longer than anyone wants to stare at the same supertux level. So unlimited air supply should be okay. --[[User:WolfgangB|WolfgangB]] 14:38, 17 Aug 2006 (BST)
:Ad√©lie penguins like Tux can hold their breaths for over 15 minutes, and emperor penguins can go for even longer. --[[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 04:33, 25 June 2009 (UTC)
: Existing levels shouldn't be a problem. Water was never dangerous on its own, so those pits are either bottomless or filled with hazards. This way, Tux will never get stuck. Some levels of the main storyline probably need to be adjusted, so you can't just skip parts of the level by swimming, but that's OK when releasing a new major version...
