== level question ==

what is the level 'owls revenge' for? I don't see any skydives.

and there is a lot of enemies on the badguy pages that said it got implemented but I never seen them anywhere like the owl. is the owl in that level?

: A lot of the enemies are only in test levels, because the main levels were created before the enemy existed. So Owl's Revenge doesn't include any owls (yet). But you're welcome and encouraged to update the existing levels to use the new tiles and badguys. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 16:15, 9 July 2011 (UTC)
