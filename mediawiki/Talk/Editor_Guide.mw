Hey Monstertux, is that okay if I work on this? - CT. da'Bomb

Dear... Person. ;-) Thank you! I just wanted to be clear with everyone. <br>--[[User:Monster|Monstertux]] 21:42, 31 October 2011 (UTC)

:Every level needs a "main" sector. This is the first sector the player enters. You can have other sectors, but you need "main". --[[Special:Contributions/88.130.20.86|88.130.20.86]] 11:40, 1 November 2011 (UTC)

== ... this editor is intended for Windows XP ==

This misunderstanding is probably caused by the .exe extension, which is the extension for compiled C# programs on all platforms. The editor is not intended for Windows XP. It it written in C#, mostly on Linux. So if you claim it is intended for any platform that would be GNU/Linux. --[[Special:Contributions/88.130.20.86|88.130.20.86]] 11:40, 1 November 2011 (UTC)

==To everyone interested in editing this guide==

It's okay with me if you edit this guide, because I really don't have much time to work on it now. Go ahead, but make it clear and not confusing on how you make a level.

Thanks!
