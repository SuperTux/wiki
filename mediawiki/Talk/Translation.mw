== Old Fake Entry, Recent Vandalism ==

[http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/index.php?title=Translation&diff=10197&oldid=10195 Tried] to fix some old fake entries without adding in recent vandalism.
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonne_Valtonen Jonne Valtonen] as translator for de and fi was introduced in http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/index.php?title=Translation&diff=prev&oldid=8604 without reason or SVN entry.
The rest of http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/index.php?title=Translation&diff=10195&oldid=10184 looks like putting vandalism back in. No source for the languages given, [http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Myusernameher user] makes some suspicious moves of other user pages. Doses not look like he does Filipino Serbian as well as Spanish.
