I think some new behaviours that have not been seen in the IceWorld would be interesting. I change the behaviour so that they always walk towards tux. - Matze

:When possible I would vary the reaction on fire and ice flower. SnowBall melts to steam on fire impact and nothing happens on ice impact. MudBall freezes on ice impact and dries on fire impact. In its dry state the MadBall can become faster and aggressive. Only jumping on it can kill it. --[[User:Johnlein|Johnlein]] 12:02, 6 Apr 2005 (BST)

perhaps mudballs should be like snowballs in IceWorld and thus have flying, bouncy, etc forms. -F50
