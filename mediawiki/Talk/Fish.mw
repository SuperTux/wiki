==Proposal for swimming fish==
It is implied that there are planned implementations for a swimming Tux. This would obviously mean that fish that merely jump up and down would be obsolete.
While I wouldn't care whether or not it is the same jumping and swimming fish, I think that a fish that swims after Tux would be of interest. Since Tux would not reasonably be able to use fire or ice under the water (though using ice pellets to freeze the water's surface into unstable ice tiles would be awesome :D), he should be able to "eat" the fish somehow (possibly requiring the BigTux powerup?). Is there anyone who think that this would be a reasonable addition to Milestone 3? --[[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 19:31, 25 June 2009 (UTC)
