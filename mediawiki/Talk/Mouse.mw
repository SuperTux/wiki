Moving left-right is clear - this would be controlled by mouse motion. Jump should be left-click, action would be right-click or a key (I would simply add the ability to map mouse events to actions), and the other not-so-common actions should be mapped to keys. --[[User:Špule|Špule]] 15:22, 28 May 2007 (UTC)

Dunno about that.  With all the left-right moving you'll be doing, it'd be REALLY cumbersome to drag that much. [[User:72.69.5.10|72.69.5.10]] 18:34, 28 May 2007 (UTC)
