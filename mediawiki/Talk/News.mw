 Mission to Snowdriftland is a very SuperTux'ish Flash Jump'n Run used for
 advertisment by Nintendo, it features 24 levels and great level and secret
 area design, everybody should have a deep look at this game to get some
 inspiration for Milestone2

"Best performace with Microsoft Internet ExplorerÂ®." I don't think thats a good inspiration.
