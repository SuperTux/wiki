F50: The earthquake/lanslide idea (not neccesarily killing all of the badguys on the screen) mentioned in the previous          incarnation of this page might be useful for super jump only, in order to unlock different areas of a level or mass-slaughter badguys. Could also be dangerous since the place where Tux jumped from might colapse on himself :D. might also break certain objects (scripted?) like pipes making them spew water. if i am going too far please tell me.
