The bjella could be like the purple flying thing in milestone 2. But it would stop and sting tux. Then tux could jump on it. And the limpy could be like an inch worm. It would strech out and tux couldn't atack it, but when it squishes back up, you can jump on it. --[[User:TON|TON]] 19:45, 25 November 2007 (UTC)
