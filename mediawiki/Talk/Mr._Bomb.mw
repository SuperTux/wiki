FlyingPenguins, are you having browser troubles or something? Your edit blanked the page. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 21:00, 28 Apr 2006 (BST)
*Well, when I edited the page with my added votes and stuff, when I saved it, the page was blanked. And when I checked the page history, you had made an edit before me, and that edit was empty, so I thought you had blanked the topic. Sorry about the blanking, though I think it was something in the MediaWiki software or my Firefox brower that made the page and page edit content in the prior edits blank. Anyways, I readded my comments. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 08:42, 29 Apr 2006 (BST)


'''BuBuaBu :''' When a MrBomb is hurt by a kicked badguy, I think that he could be jump and then being ticking

'''litespeed:''' I like BuBuaBu's idea... anywho... I think that after being hit by a kicked badguy it would be a nice thing if mister bomb would start to slide (just as if being kicked, too) along ticking -- that's offer some new possibilities. :-)

'''yukaili :''' What would bump exactly mean?

'''sik0fewl:''' ''bump'' is when Tux hits a block from below and the badguy is killed if he's standing on the block

'''FlyingPenguins:''' I kind of prefer how Super Mario Bros. 3 handles Bob-Ombs. They shouldn't be affected by fireballs (if that is what "shot" means), can be killed by running through them with invincibility, being bumped from underneath, or being run over by a kicked badguy, and if squished, they will remain dormant for a few seconds before blinking and exploding.

'''Afief:''' couldn't it be made that when a kicked badguy hits mr.bomb he does a little jump and then starts ticking? same effect would be cool for bump too. (didn't know how to explain that in the table)

'''Julius_Freezer:''' I think that the bomb should end up exploding/ticking for most outcomes. I see the whole point of the bomb being that it blows up. However, I don't have any problem with it just falling off when being bumped (though I ''do'' think it would be cool if that set it ticking). --[[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 15:42, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

'''m_gol:''' IMHO the old Mr. Bomb looked nice, the new one is just ugly. Even the explosion was made better in the old version, now it looks very poor. Are You sure it's the right direction? [[User:M gol|m_gol]] 06:42, 11 April 2010 (UTC)
