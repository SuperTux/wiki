== Remove the Debian/Ubuntu header! ==

Ubuntu doesn't have the stable version of SuperTux anymore. Until the [https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/supertux/+bug/84084 situation is clarified], remove the header, or at least add a warning notice.
:Done, added warning on 0.3.0 download page. You should've posted this under the Milestone 1.9 download talk though, it would make more sense. --[[User:FlyingPenguins|FlyingPenguins]] 04:57, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

== Supertux on GameCube ==

Looks like they ported Supertux on cube, look:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=98581&package_id=181273

==PcLinuxOs==

Pclinuxos has stable supertux in the repository.
: It can be installed with an apt-get command, the same way it is on Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install supertux. PCLinuxOS uses apt-get with RPM files.

==Mac OS X==

It is Mac OS X, not Mac OS/X. OS/X sounds awfully like OS/2.
:GNU/Linux? SCNR.

== PC-BSD port ==

There is also a PC-BSD port of Supertux;
see http://www.pbidir.com/packages.php?code=434
Please add it to the list.

== Supertux on Ubuntu ==

Actually, ubuntu 7.04feisty has both "supertux" and "supertux-stable" packages
  (i.e. 0.3.0 and 0.1.3 versions).
:7.10 gusty has the same. 0.3.1 isnt there...
Debian has "supertux" (which is stable 0.1.3) and the 'experimental' release
  has the new version of supertux ...

: The whole Ubuntu thing ticks me off. I asked them to provide different SuperTux packages, and they decided to make it so that SuperTux-0.3.0 is considered an upgrade, rather than a preview. --[[User:Djwings|DJ Wings]][[User_talk:Djwings|<sub>Freesyle here</sub>]]: N0 PH33R 01:02, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

== Linux ports ==

I'd edit it myself, but it seems that I don't have permission to do so, so I guess I'll have to request it:

First of all, the link which is supposed to explain how to run the automatic installer is broken. It has been moved from [http://autopackage.org/docs/howto-install/index.html] to [http://www.autopackage.org/howtoinstall.html].

Second, the current supertux package for Fedora is actually the Supertux development snapshot (0.3.1), not the stable version. The Fedora section should be edited to reflect this. I would wager to guess that this is also the case for some other Linux distributions as well.
