debug_collrects

This function lets you see the collision rectangles around a game creature or other object. The rectangle appears as a shaded box over the object's graphic. To see this feature, from the in game console screen type "debug_collrects(true)". 

The main reference says (enable), where maybe it should say (true) instead?

:What reference would this be? All I know about is the code documentation. (which is this page, copied word-for-word) Anyway, enable is used because you can also do debug_collrects(false) to disable drawing of collision rectangles. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 17:09, 21 September 2008 (UTC)
