This page is currently a mix of bugs and user comments on bugs. Anybody care to clean it up? :) - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 09:59, 5 Apr 2005 (BST)

Well actually we can leave it as is. But please don't fill support requests here! Only fill in things that are clearly real bugs (better ask in irc channel or mailing list first).

== Negative Lives ==

"If an enemy kills Tux and the user elects to abort the level before he falls off the screen, gameplay may continue with negative lives. This happens when Tux looses his last life."   i HAD THAT HAPPEN TO ME.

: I'll have to substract one point from your overall score for only re-reporting the second bug on the [[Bugs]] page. Try to get the first one next time... --[[User:84.146.251.243|84.146.251.243]] 13:54, 29 Oct 2006 (CET)

== Windows version ==

Tried the Windows version from the download page. The game just leaves my monitor black and I even can't kick it out.

== Possible Keyboard Bug ==
I think I found a possible bug in the windows version of the game.  I am using the newest version 0.1.3.  Sometimes for no appearant reason Tux keeps on moving to the right without me telling him to.  My keyboard is a traditional IBM keyboard that is connect to a USB adapter that connects into my laptop.  Thanks for your help guys.  --[[User:Mattwj2002|Mattwj2002]] 15:53, 28 Nov 2006 (CET)
:Since it is on a laptop, please take the keyboard out of the equation and check if the laptop keyboard exhibits the bug.  If so, I have to think more.  If not, try using the keyboard on another computer and see if it exhibits the bug. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 16:39, 28 Nov 2006 (CET)

== Mantis Broken ==

I tried to report a bug, but when I click "Report Issue" firefox downloads login_select_proj_page.php and thats all. The file contains a mixture of html code, http header and binary. --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 17:57, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

I'll add the bug below instead:

== Crash  Couldn't unqueue audio buffer==

Supertux svn r5911 sometimes crashes with
 Fatal: Unexpected exception: Couldn't unqueue audio buffer: Invalid Value

Not really sure how to reproduce it. I played world 1 and was dying when it happend. But usually that does not cause a crash, just about 1 in 20 or so. Debian testing on x86. --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 17:57, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

== Bug Tracker Registration ==

I registered an account at the bugtracker a few days ago and have yet to receive a confirmation email. I requested a password reminder hoping that would work but it hasn't arrived either.

I signed up for an account on another email address today but it seems like it's doing the same thing. Is registration enabled? -- Qwood [[Special:Contributions/Qwood|(contribs)]] [[User talk:Qwood|(talk)]] 13:45, 16 July 2011 (UTC)

=== Editor: Dispencer === 

I can't sign up to bug tracker. Waited for two days for confirmation mails. So here is the problem:
Current SVN-Editor. Can't place Mr. Rocket at all. Also putting snowshot in dispenser  does not work. --[[Special:Contributions/209.236.66.136|209.236.66.136]] 18:22, 12 December 2011 (UTC)
