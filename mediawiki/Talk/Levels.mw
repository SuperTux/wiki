how do you go from one level to the next in level editor?


===Placing a link===
Is there a preferred method of doing this--i.e., a certain website, or making a page with the level's contents? --[[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 23:42, 6 July 2009 (UTC)
:Creating a bug in the bug tracker and uploading your levels in a zip or similar should work. See [[Contributing]]. --[[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 00:06, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
