Can I upload my own demos to the wiki? [[User:Mathnerd314|Mathnerd314]] 21:48, 31 October 2007 (UTC)
:If you need to add a demo to your bugreport just attach it to the report directly. Maybe a testsuit of demos is an option for automated testing. But better add them to svn directly. --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 23:51, 31 October 2007 (UTC)
