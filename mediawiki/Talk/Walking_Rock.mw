So what's the difference between [[Moving platform]] and [[Walking Rock]]?

It might have additional features:
* invincible
* can be frozen/unfrozen
* hurts Tux and kills enemies on lateral contact and when falling on them (might kill Big Tux directly). (This is because Waling Rock is big, heavy and able tu crush smaller creatures)
* carries Tux/enemies on its head
* falls down from cliffs like Snowballs
* may float over lava (maybe more like walking than floating)

:I like the "float over lava" difference.  Platforms are made of wood and burn up.  Rocks don't. --[[User:Tuxdev|Tuxdev]] 00:45, 15 Sep 2006 (BST)
This should be called Walking Boulder to prevent confusion.[[User:Tuxsmash|Tuxsmash]] 19:06, 3 March 2010 (UTC)
