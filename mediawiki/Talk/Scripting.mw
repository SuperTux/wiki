Squirrel appears to be a nice language and version 2 was released just now. The only thing I do not like is the :: before functions. --[[User:Johnlein|Johnlein]] 22:22, 7 Apr 2005 (BST)
: Hmm.. after a quick scan, it looks to me that '::' is used in front of classes and print (maybe print is some sort of class). In any case, I think that the '::' isn't just there for the fun of it a and is there for a reason. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 23:44, 7 Apr 2005 (BST)
