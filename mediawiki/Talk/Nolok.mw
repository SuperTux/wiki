==Just a Thought==
I like the most the furry one Nolok.. it shouln't be so close to Bowser, it is not funny just to be a redone clone of him.. I think it would fit more if it were furry and look like a feline, a evil and big cat who likes to "play" with birds like penguins, also a cat would be a good antithesis in my opinion, since cats hate cold and water while penguins love it.. of course the feline Nolok would have armor and all that so it would end up looking simmilar to the graphis already done, it would just need a different skin to mnake it furry, it would make it have a different look so it doesnt turn in a "Bowser falsification".. It is nice that SuperTux was based on SuperMario.. but I think it can be more than a pure clone. The feline Nolok could be some kind of wizard casting thunderbolts and fireballs, teleporting himself through the screen, etc. --[[User:Ferk|Ferk]] 23:24, 11 Aug 2006 (BST)
:EDIT: But then he's close to the boss in Yoshi's Island --samexner
::I didn't played Yoshi's Island too much. But after some research I found that the final boss in there is Bowser too :S ..and his caretaker in the flying broomstick belongs to the same species as Bowser.. to me, he does not look like a cat, he even has beak and spectacles. --[[User:Ferk|Ferk]] 22:28, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

== a croc? ==

Why not make Nolok a crocodile?

== Battle against Nolok ==

I thought in the battle against Nolok, maybe he could jump off a platform, roll up and then roll along the bottom of the screen. Then he unrolls himself and jumps up onto another platform. Then he could use some kind of special power, like in SuperMario Bowser breathing fire, and then jump off, roll up, and so on. Oh yeah, i like the crocodile idea.

::No, but Tux '''must''' fight Nolok in the end to reclaim Penny, everyone knows. Maybe since Nolok has horns Tux can't jump on his head (like the Yeti) but can attack him when moving?... And a crocodile would NOT be in Antarctica (they are cold-blooded--like Nolok, I suppose [heh heh]--so they would need a warm/hot climate). Perhaps he could be a leopard seal with a helmet and armor or something. (Leopard seals are the worst enemy of penguins in real life, so why couldn't they be in the game, too?)[[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 22:51, 17 May 2009 (UTC)
:::The fact that crocodiles are cold-blooded actually would make since because he would hate the cold, but Tux likes the cold.
Nolok must be killed. However, someone should sit down and experiment first.

== Which Nolok to use? ==
*My personal favorite is the one that is the gif animation. It looks exactly like how I had pictured him and it fits the statue just right.[[User:Julius Freezer|Julius_Freezer]] 22:51, 17 May 2009 (UTC)
*Feline Nolok
:I really like the big form feline Nolok.(just throwing in my 2 cents)

== Skirpy? ==

What about fighting Skirpy before as a sort of mini-boss? Have him go before Nolok? (Or as a separate boss?)
:Whats a skirpy? --[[User:Superdev|Superdev]] 12:22, 29 December 2008 (UTC)
::This thing: http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/persistent/images/b/bb/Possi6.jpg

What is Nolok? A croc (like said above), a dragon? and.. Why did he kidnap Penny, just to lure Tux into a trap (if so, he shouldn't be running/hiding from Tux, as the proposed [[story]] for further beyond makes us believe)?
