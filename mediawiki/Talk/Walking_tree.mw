== Shrinking the Tree ==

IMO, trees should be like those dragons in SM3, where you hit them once to shrink them and then another hit to squish them. - Ricardo

if you *want* to shrink them, they'd be useful as a shield or raft at times. - zratchet


== Various Proposals ==

* I personally think that the burning tree idea is very cool and good. I for one would like to see it implemented!
* "Spooky" Tree -- I don't like the entire "ghost forest" concept (except that Skullyhops are fun!), but perhaps a simply dead forest might be okay with the spooky tree and bats. Perhaps...
* ...Mr. Tree could release birds? I ''really'' like that idea.
* Branches: More realistic, but doesn't really seem to fit the theme. Tux can't ride around on any of the other bad guys (just jump from badguy to badguy w/o touching the ground), so probably not this one, either, I think...
