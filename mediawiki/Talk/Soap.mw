== Implementation idea ==

Bubbles explode when:

# Tux jumps on them three times (gives him time to jump on once or twice, and jump off)
# Tux doesn't get all the way on but hits the side or bottom
# after 10 seconds
# if a spit or badguy hits them

They should slowly float upwards... also possibly there should be fans or things that can blow them

They could also come out of pipes... perhaps have buttons on some pipes that Tux could jump on to release bubbles, or have no button and just have them automatically released sometimes.

== Bubble Idea ==

Bubbles should be able to catch enemies, then Tux could jump on the bubble to squish it and the enemy. Also, they could act as trampolines if Tux does the Ground Pound on them, shooting him about ten tiles up or so.
