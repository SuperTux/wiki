== Play as Penny ==
A friend gave me the following idea: At some part of the game, Penny manages to escape on her own and the player takes over her role for a while. Depending on how well Penny does, Tux' following levels change in design and/or difficulty. - Wansti

I like the idea of playing the Penny/Rixz character, but not other graphics which we don't own the rights to. These should be implemented as hacks and posted to the fan site, but not official. Ballmer the developer developer developer  monkey should be a Tux hack too. - Groundwater

I removed Rix because the suggestion wasn't much more than a name (I like the name though :) and the character doesn't fit into the story anywhere. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 10:22, 5 Apr 2005 (BST)
