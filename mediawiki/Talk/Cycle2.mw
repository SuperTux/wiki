Regarding: 
== Worldmap Layout Flow ==

The initial layout of the world 2 forest map did not match the original design specifications for MS2.
The Dark Forest Keep (castle) was surrounded by a light forest, which was surrounded by a dark forest. This layout was the opposite of our specification.

After some brief discussion on IRC it was decided that we would rework the map to follow Delta's suggestion below.

== Design a little sequence (+music?) that is shown when tux finds a key ==


So far we have a graphic that displays sparkels just before the key goes on the scoreboard area. This is just a hacked in loop of images at the moment. We need a way to play this animation just once as the key fades out of the main screenplay area, then once as the key fades onto the scoreboard area. 

At the same time as the key fades off the main screenplay area, we could use to replace the Tux player sprite with a "Tux just found key - yippie-" animation set.

Grumbel had made a backflip animation set somewhere along the way, maybe we could use these graphics for the -yippie- animation series.

Does anyone with good sound skills want to submit some sample files for a "Tada - Yippie" music noise?
