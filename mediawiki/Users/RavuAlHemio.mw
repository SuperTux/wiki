'''Ravu al Hemio''', known to the surroundings as '''Ondra Hosek''', is a hobby programmer. He is not very creative and his logical thinking is limited to consequential thinking, which is pretty useful in programming but totally useless in school maths, which frustrates him to excess. He wrote multiple patches for SuperTux after [[User:MatzeB|MatzeB]]'s '''Big Commit&trade;'''.

He is known by many as a whiner and pessimist, but he is trying to shut himself up as well and often as possible. He has not yet considered therapy for his lack of self-confidence, but it does seem to him as a sane alternative to any more drastic actions.

Once upon a time, he was simply writing documentation and fixing '''L'''-rated bugs for the SuperTux project. Then, through a fortunate series of events, he got promoted from ''Contrib Programmer'' to ''Programmer'' and received SysOp/Bureaucrat rights on this wiki. So, now he writes documentation and code as well as posting URIs with ''http'' in the protocol part.

In January 2006, he became hooked to gaming again and started booting Windows more often, which prevented him from working on SuperTux due to Windows's hateful stance towards developers. However, on April 9th 2006, he was given a Mac mini for his birthday on the following day, which instantly returned him to development again. He since then monitors development, makes sure SuperTux compiles on both Intel and PowerPC Macs and occasionally fixes bugs.

He still has to update his photo in the credits to reflect his new, longer-and-a-bit-unruly hairstyle, with which he can do headbangs while failing dismally at playing the guitar.
