Here, I have accumulated and will accumulate the thoughts that came to my head while playing SuperTux. Since this is a community project, it is up to others to say if these thoughts are valid or not.

*As long as the bell is not touched, it stays stationary, attracting minimal attention as opposed to when it is activated and starts ringing. Shouldn't the bell first attract attention by ringing and stop when Tux touches it?
