Hey, it's me, Matt McCutchen (http://mattmccutchen.net/, mailto:matt@mattmccutchen.net).  I make some contributions of interest to me but am less involved in the large-scale advancement of the project.

I maintain a modified version of SuperTux, including some changes intended for upstream, in a git repository at https://mattmccutchen.net/private/supertux.git/ .

See my [[/Bugs|list of unreported bugs]].
