== About Me ==

I'm a french person that play supertux since it come on Ubuntu.
I use Ubuntu and for testing, I use Windows.
I have a pen tablet to make computer graphics like the image below.

I use Inkscape to make a global mockup of that I want to make.
I use Gimp to make photorealistic or draw-style images.
For scripting, I use Geany.
I have made script in Html, Css, Javascript, Php, Bash, C/C++, Basic, Asm, Basic on Casio and Ti.
I made script now in Html, Css, Javascript, Php and Bash because I work on my website ( that is not online ).

== What did I expect from Supertux ? ==

I expect that supertux can be comparable of the SMB/NSMB on Nintendo DS, and that everybody can make easely a level for supertux, without having trouble.

== What I do for supertux ? ==

I'm making a level that have all tiles from one type, and make it more complete with new tiles.


== What can I do for supertux ? ==

I can help for making levels, debuging levels and make additional graphics.

I can help for find bug and suggestion.

And for now make supertux have more complete tileset for one type of tiles ( for example snow tiles)

== What other project I wan't they exist ? ==

Like SuperTux is a Mario's clone, I think that a clone of a 2D version of "The legend of Zelda" will come in a equivalent quality, and make it easy to create new level for this game.
