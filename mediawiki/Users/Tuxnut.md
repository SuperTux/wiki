[[Image:Tux pwn.png|right]]Helloes. I'm an ST fan, eagerly waiting for the editor to work on Win7. I might also be preparing an online level editor with JavaScript and PHP, in the far future...

### ST Feature Wish List
*Scripted dispensers
*Script triggers for non-player objects
*Temporary disabling of backflip
*Large or different-colored coins that provide greater awards
*Actual use for coins in the first place
*Allow modification of time limit in supertux-editor (which might be useful for levels like "You have one minute.")

</div>
