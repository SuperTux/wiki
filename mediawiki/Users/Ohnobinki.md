# OhNoBinki
A username/nickname used for me across many services, including [http://freenode.net FreeNode] and [http://sourceforge.net sf.net]. See [http://ohnopublishing.net/~ohnobinki my pointless homepage].

Me as tux: http://ohnopublishing.net/~ohnobinki/pictures/getpic.php?id=3424&maxx=400&maxy=300

## Preferences
I prefer the [http://gentoo.org/ Gentoo] distribution of [http://gnu.org/ GNU]/[http://kernel.org/ Linux]. I use [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ Emacs], [http://seamonkey-project.org/ SeaMonkey], GNU Screen, and irssi during my daily computer usage tasks.

I am against the use of proprietary technologies that don't work in websites, such as Adobe Flash. I'm not sure if this is because they don't work, because they are primarily used to distribute pointless advertising, or because I think flash is just chinsey.
