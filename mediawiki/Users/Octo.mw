Hi, my name is ''Florian Forster'' and I usually go by the nick of “octo”. I'm committing to the SVN repository as “florianf”.

You can contact me on ''freenode'', via email at <code>&lt;supertux&nbsp;at&nbsp;octo.it&gt;</code> and via Jabber/XMPP at <code>&lt;octo&nbsp;at&nbsp;verplant.org&gt;</code>. My GnuPG key is <code>0x0C705A15</code>, but my mails to the ''SuperTux'' mailing list are not signed (the content type isn't allowed). My homepage is at http://octo.it/

Regards,<br />
—octo

== Levels ==

I have made a couple of levels of my own. They are described on my homepage at: http://octo.it/supertux/

To get the newest version of the levels, check out my Git repository at
 git://git.verplant.org/supertux-levels.git
There's also a [http://git.verplant.org/?p=supertux-levels.git;a=summary Gitweb interface] to the repository.

Please note that these levels are made with the latest SVN version at that time. If you find anything broken in a version ''newer'' than the levels, please let me know.

== Release checklist ==

* Set <code>SUPERTUX_VERSION</code> in [[Template:SvnFile|CMakeLists.txt]].
* Replace image in [[Template:SvnFile|data/images/objects/logo/logo.sprite]]<br />''logo_dev.png → logo.png''
