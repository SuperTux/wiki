Hi!

...I'm very surprised that you're reading this. How did you get here anyway?

I created an account here because SuperTux is one of my <i>favorite</i> games. I even took all the trouble to get the repository and try it. This page is mainly for my ideas for SuperTux.

===My Ideas===

-I tried revision 6630 (the latest as of April 5) and it took me a while to figure out that to start a level I needed to press space after I entered it on the worldmap.

-I think that more additional paths should be added to the worldmap (not entirely back to the state in Milestone 1.9 where you only need to complete 5 or 6 levels to get to the forest, but at least so that there are 2 ways to get to the castle of Nolok and the yeti boss fight)

-Make it easier to compile the Supertux editor for Mac. We can't figure out how to do it.

-In the editor, much of the shortcuts rely on the F-keys, which don't work for Mac.

-I think that if all the worlds that are in the "worlds" page are implemented, Supertux would be too big for most computers. Maybe it should be limited to about 5 worlds:
-Icyisland
-Forest
-Tropical Islands
-Desert
-Nolok's dungeons

I'd appreciate feedback on these ideas.
