The Evil Penguin should look similar to Tux, it will probally have another color and another shaped bill. Ranges of attack might be something simple such as spitting balls or eggs at Tux. There might even be multiple levels of evil penguins with different behaviours (fire, ice).

A few more behaviours (i.e. as if they were jungle tribesmen): Spearthrow, Blowgun, Boomerang, Net, etc.

Maybe they're friendly penguins enslaved by Nolok and Tux could free them?
