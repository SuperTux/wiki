_This page aims to gather the types of themes each world should have/needs to feel complete!_

**General themes** are open to optional alternate tracks to allow for some variety in levels of the same theming.

**Specific themes** are set and do not require alternate tracks as they are used for very specific level themes, like boss battles,
special levels (e.g. Crystal Mine, Between Two Glaciers, Ancient Ruin), worldmaps etc.

Non-World Tied Themes
---------------------

These themes (the main theme especially) if anything could use some slight touch ups and tweaking in form of a remix of sorts
to improve their overall sound quality, choice of instruments etc.

The credits theme may be subject to some more than just a remix, depending on what feel we want to go with. Right now it is on
the more slow, melancholic side.

- [ ] Main theme (Tux theme)
- [ ] Credits theme
- [ ] Invincibility theme (star powerup)


World 1 - Icy Island
--------------------

The music of Icy Island should properly represent Tux's homeland. A familiar and vivid winter wonderland.
Only the icy caves and underwater themes should be more calm and reserved for the most part, but still keep
a similar spirit overall. The castle and (potentially) the outpost themes being the only truly intense themes of
world 1 (the current `airship_remix.ogg` has a fitting vibe for the outpost so it could be used as a reference point here)!

The Crystal Mine's theme should be the most different out of the musical pieces of world 1, as it represents Tux leaving the
familiar island - preparing to leave his home and traveling towards the unknown (Rooted Forest) to rescue his beloved friend!
A mix worry but also determination.

### General Themes

- Surface level theme (ideally one for sunrise/-set, midday, night)
  - [x] Midday
    - [x] Midday alt.
  - [x] Sunset
  - [x] Night

- [x] Underground level theme

- [x] Castle level theme

- [ ] Mini boss theme (more info must be gathered prior)
- [x] Crystal cave level theme
- [x] Snow Fort theme
- [x] Glacier Outpost theme


World 2 - Rooted Forest
-----------------------

The music of Rooted Forest should focus more on the mystique, beauty and wonder of the brand-new environment.
A place Tux has never seen before. Exciting but with a little bit of caution! The Granito themes
should be closer to the feel of Icy Island, minus the Ruins theme. A safe and welcoming place inhabited by kind, yet curious
creatures bouncing around in a beautiful and calm landscape. The ancient ruins of Granito on the other hand are more mysterious and ominous
sounding in nature - abandoned

The themes for nighttime levels and thunderstorms should feel much more intense due to the powerful lightning
strikes and bombardment from the Owls. A nice climactic end to the forest world, right before the hidden
underground outpost and dark tunnels, ultimately followed by the Corrupted Forest!

The underground outpost and the dark underground level right after are the transition from normal to corrupted forest.
Ideally their themes should make you feel more uneasy but not give a way the horrors yet to come. Like a looming evil
you cannot quite put your finger on. Depending on how it is done, both levels might be able to share a theme.

### General Themes

World 2.5 - Corrupted Forest
----------------------------

The music of the Corrupted Forest should reflect the emptiness and lifelessness of the once bright and
vibrant forest - focusing more on the uncertainty of what happened for the more "calm", ominous and slow
paced themes, with the faster paced themes focusing more on the destruction and horrifying attributes of
the corruption.

Potentially some "twisted" remixes of normal forest themes or at least some slight references here and
there to connect them closer together. The Corrupted Granito themes going in a more somber direction as
the once welcoming and lively Granito are now nothing but a mindless husk, roaming the fully overtaken
and destroyed villages and ruins

For the final level of world 2 (likely named "Regrowth"), the theme should bare a more hopeful tone.
At last a moment of relief! The Ghost Tree has been destroyed and the forest slowly begins to recover.
However the damage left by the Corruption (e.g. broken terrain, ruined land) do remain as a reminder of
what happend. Grateful for Tux's help, Granito are helping Tux too, proceeding to carry him across the
ocean towards the 3rd world, Tropical Paradise!

### General Themes

- Surface level theme (one calm, one intense)
  - [ ] calm, uneasy
  - [ ] tense, threatening
- [ ] Underground level theme
- [ ] Sky/Airborne level theme (not quite part of Story Mode but useful more vertical/mountainous levels)
- [ ] Underwater level theme (not part of Story Mode but useful for those who wish to make a corrupted water level)

### Specific Themes

- [ ] Worldmap theme
- [ ] Castle level theme
- [ ] Corrupted Granito level theme
- [ ] Corrupted Granito Ruin level theme
- [ ] Thunderstorm level theme
- [ ] Ghost Tree boss theme
- [ ] Mini boss theme (more info must be gathered prior)

World 4 - Nolok's Mountain Peak
-------------------------------

The specific themes of Nolok's Mountain Peak should feel quite ominous, with references to past worlds' motives.
An exception will be the worldmap theme as it should reference Nolok's (potential) battle theme but in a more slow
paced, intimidating style.

The general themes will go in a more unique direction, away from referencing past worlds, with more vast and open
feel due to all you be seeing is an endless sky of thick clouds below you. A mix of calm but daunting.
