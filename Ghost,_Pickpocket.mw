This ghost will try to '''steal''' up to one powerup or coin from Tux. If it succeeds its formerly visibly '''hollow belly''' will contain the stolen item and it will switch from chasing Tux to evading Tux. After some seconds it will have '''digested''' the stolen item and come back to steal a new one.
