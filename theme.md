Something this game seems to be missing since most of its development time was a theme. This page is meant to fix some of those issues by laying down the main idea and concept for design and world/level themes for further development on the game's main story. If you would like to contribute to help finishing the main game, we highly recommand reading through this!  

World Themes
------------

The game's world themes are choosen to be diverse in terms of overall appearnce and climate and gameplay elements. From the cold antarctic landscape to the lukewarm forests to the tropical beaches of a distant jungle, we want Tux's journey to feature as much design variety as possible.

The first world, Icy Island, serves as the basic introduction into the games core mechanics. Rooted Forest, the game's second world will introduce more complex and puzzle oriented elements. The third world, Tropical Paradise, is set to lay a huge focus on Tux's swimming ability and take full advantage of it with more unique obsatcles and challenges. The fourth and final world, Nolok's Mountain Peak, will combine all elements of each world but in an even more challenging way and with its own unique spin. It will also feature more mechanical elements, like a bomb factory or mechanical badguys.

Worldmap Design
---------------

Similar to how a world's theme is chosen, each world is supposed to have its own unique worldmap design. Icy Island is an antarctic island thus being designed to look like an island. Rooted Forest, unlike the game's first world, is a not an island but part of a large landmass. In order to not have it be too big however, the game only takes place on the southern part of the forest. Despite being island based again, Tropical Paradise's uniqueness comes from the fact that it is the only world that features multiple small isles rather than one big island. Nolok's Mountain Peak compared to all other worlds is very small and takes place primarly inside a fortress located on a snowy mountain peak above the clouds.

Boss Fights
-----------

The game is set to feature five boss enemies in total. Each boss has five lives in story mode and activates Pinch Mode when on their last two lives. All boss fights are meant to vary in how they are fought and how they behave.

The Yeti, the boss of Icy Island, behaves like a more traditionaly, straight forward boss. He walks back and forth in a level and attacks upon reaching one side of the arena. Avoid his attacks and jump on his head. Simple.

The fight against the Ghost Tree, the boss of Rooted Forest, will be more round based. Tux can only attack them during a certain attack whereas the Yeti can be attacked in between attack and even during his attacks (if skilled enough).

The boss fight Tropical Paradise, Toucan and Totem, are unique in the way that you have to fight two seperate boss enemies at once (however they also seperate from oneanother). Toucan attacks the player from high up while granting a chance for a counter attack every once and awhile. Totem, in the meantime, will attempt to hurt Tux with varying attacks. Their attacks are depended on their amount of lives!

Nolok is the final boss of the game and is going to appear in Nolok's Mountain Peak. It is yet not confirmed how his boss fight is going to procced. Either Nolok uses a combination of attacks based on past boss fights and his own unique attacks or Nolok only uses a unique moveset of his own.
