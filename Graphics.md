## Want To Help The SuperTux Team?

We need artists, who can provide us with images to use in the game. This file should provide a good starting point for anyone willing to contribute.

We currently are not offering money for any contributions, unless a member of the team has said otherwise, although this is unlikely.

Please play the game, to see if it's something you're interested in.

Please join us on [IRC](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/wiki/IRC), and ask for more details about contributing Graphics.
